Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00013=I feel ya'. Man's got a duty to stand up and be counted sometimes.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00017=So how'd you enjoy your little vacation dirtside?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00018=How're you holding up down here, chief?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00019=Ah hell, we were stupid. Havin' right on your side ain't no match for gauss guns and combat walkers. Lotta' folks died for nothin'. If you hadn't shown up when you did...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00020=Hey, your people bought their own freedom - paid for it in blood. Me and Matt, we were just glad to help.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00021=Next time you need a volunteer, you go right ahead and volunteer someone else!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00023=What do ya' mean?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00024=Your girl's made herself a lot of enemies over the years. If that damned artifact does what you hope it does they won't hesitate goin' through you to get to her.   
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00025=(chuckles) Thanks, man. You know we couldn't have done it without you.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00026=[Happy 70]Better now we got our old commander back. [/Happy]Oh, and our new best friend Prince Charming came through with some upgraded battlecruiser schematics. I been working on some... interesting modifications for our ships.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00030=Upgrading what we got is all well and good, but when're we getting new hardware? Lotta gaps in our inventory right now.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00040=What's up, cowboy? Y'know you're lookin' kinda rough lately - rougher than usual, I mean.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00041=That Tosh character gave me the data for buildin' more Spectre gear. You sure we can trust that guy? I heard he was into brainwashing or something. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00042=Tosh can only recruit volunteers to become Spectres. That's the deal. He works 'em hard so they won't go off the rails when they get their full Spectre powers. No brainwashing involved.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00043=[Happy 50]Good to know. Wouldn't want any of those freaks running loose causin' trouble. [/Happy]Aside from Tosh, that is. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00044=Nova promised us access to Ghost technology for helping her. She come through with it yet?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00045=Your girl came through, alright. I got a few new upgrades we're workin' on too.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00046=So...what's the problem, Swann? 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00047=I'll check 'em out. Where we're going we're gonna need all the firepower we can get.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00048=She ain't 'my girl', Swann. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00049=[Surprise 70]Hmm... scary female assassin type that's gonna wind up tryin' to kill you someday?[/Surprise] I dunno, hotshot - she sure seems like your type.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00050=(mutters) ...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00055=[Happy]Those goofy mercs are still using Vultures, can ya believe it? [/Happy]Damn things are death traps even when you ain't got people shooting at ya.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00056=Careful now, Swann. My old Vulture saved my skin more times than I care to remember. I ain't gonna listen to you trash talk a classic piece of engineering like that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00057=Classic?! I suppose you could call 'em that. 'Course most folks like a bike that don't explode on them when the repeller seals freeze up, or the fuel cells start leaking radioactive waste - [Happy 70]but hey, who cares if it's a 'classic', right?[/Happy]
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00058=No one likes a smart-ass, Swann. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00059=I've...ah...got a lot goin' on right now, Swann. You know how it is.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00060=So Swann, what're the chances we can build something like that Odin?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00061=[Surprise 70] You nuts? [/Surprise]No way we got the facilities for mass-producing hardware on that scale.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00062=And here I was thinking you could build anything, Swann.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00063=Cute. Alright - forget the scale! I'm gonna figure it out, don't you worry. An' I'll come up with something a damn sight more practical than that show piece. You see if I don't!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00064=Yeah, sure. Y 'know you might wanna try laying off the sauce and getting some shuteye once in a while, eh?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00065=Man, did ya see the size of that protoss ship? Don't matter how often I see 'em, those guys always come out with something that makes your jaw drop. Know what I'm sayin'?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00066=I'd be more impressed if they were using all that power against the zerg. It's stupid to be killing protoss when we should be teaming up with them against Kerrigan.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00067=Listen - they deserved it, and you did the right thing. Friends don't let friends massacre civilians, Jim. I'm proud of you for standing up to 'em.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00068=Do you think we coulda' saved more of those colonists? 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00069=Honest? No. And you got your head up your ass if you think any different.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00070=There had to be a better answer, though. Maybe if we caught it earlier...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00071=Look, if the protoss with all their tech, psionics and big freakin' alien brains couldn't do anything for them - there ain't nothing we could a' done. Sometimes life's just rough that way.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00076=We're rockin' some serious heavy metal now that we got siege tanks.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00077=Yessir... the comforting thunder of the big guns. Well, comforting when they're on our side.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00078=Yeah these newer tanks have better guns when they're on the move, and reinforced armor.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00079=So long as they've still got the range in siege mode, the rest is just gravy. Between siege tanks and bunkers, we can hold the line against just about anythin'.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00080=Thanks, mom. I'll get right on that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00081=Oh what the hell, cowboy, you look like crap. You been thinking about that girl again?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00082=Kinda. I just got some bad news 'bout what might happen if we can't save her.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00083=Bah, no use worrying about what might happen if you ask me. You want me to help, you just let me know. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00087=[Surprise 70]What's the problem?[/Surprise] [Angry 70]You only signed us up with our mortal enemies! Every one of these boys lost family or friends to Mengsk! [/Angry] [Sad 70]We're gonna be sittin' on a powder keg pretty soon. Can't you see that?[/Sad]
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00090=Y'know, I been watchin' the logs. Those damn protoss are still way ahead of us. I can't believe some of the stunts they can pull off.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00091=Tell me about it! They've learned some new tricks since the last time we fought.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00092=I mean c'mon, since when could they warp in guys just anywhere? I thought they needed some kinda gateway at least!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00093=Not just anywhere, they need a pylon or another power source close by. Still, they've been working to improve their tech just like us.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00094=(growls) It ain't up for discussion, Swann. I gotta do this.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00101=Ha! Y'see - told ya' I could build something better than that piece o' crap Odin.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00102=I like that. That's the spirit, brother! Show 'em who's boss!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00103=Got some work to do on the chassis still, but I got to thinkin' about upgrades and variants, y'know? They ain't gonna be cheap, cowboy. Big honkin' thing like that never is. But they'll be worth it, you'll see.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00104=That's what I like to hear! I'll take a look and see what's affordable.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00106=What in hell's name did you stir up in that lab, cowboy?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00107=Mengsk's taken to playin' god literally now. He made that thing and whole heap more like it! An' who knows how many other labs he's got out there?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00114=Great, like we ain't got enough to handle with the zerg. Now we got Mengsk breedin' his own damn monsters too.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00115=Oh this is just great, cowboy! I've got critters tryin' to chew through two decks, four engines out and half the defensive turrets are offline!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00116=Can you keep her together, Swann?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00117=Course I can! Havin' the time of my life, brother!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00118=Well you keep things workin' around here. I'll see what I can do about our rowdy neighbors.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00119=What's your status, Swann?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00120=Crappy. How're you enjoying your little vacation dirtside?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00121=Not much better. The beer's flat and the locals are ugly. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00122=Listen, cowboy  I love you like a brother. I know you got all your hopes pinned on savin' Kerrigan... But just watch your back down there.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00144=Sometimes we take a job with some kinda new hardware and I get a schematic for it so we can make more of 'em. The plans for other stuff we gotta either beg, borrow or steal.

Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00001=I'm working on a cure for the zerg virus. I just hope my people won't need it.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00003=Well, with the Dominion bein' what it is - someone's got to stand up for the little guy. It sure ain't goin' to be Mengsk.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00004=There are reports of violence and disease spreading throughout the camps, but the Emperor's done nothing!
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00005=I'll look into it, Doc. 
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00031=I've heard a lot about you, Commander. The Dominion always portrayed you as a criminal - a terrorist. There's more to you than it seems.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00034=[Sad 50]Doesn't seem like the Emperor cares at all.[/Sad] My people from Agria, and displaced populations from across the sector, have all fled to a refugee staging area on Meinhoff.

Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00001=I know, Matt - but it's been four years and we're still no closer to bringing Mengsk down. Now with the zerg back in the mix...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00002=Kerrigan's learning some new tricks. The infestation on Meinhoff seemed particularly... virulent.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00003=We can't be everywhere at once, sir. The important thing is that we set an example and gave them hope.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00007=It's about the worst thing I can imagine - losing who you are like that, all the while being slowly twisted into a damn monster.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00008=Welcome back, sir. Learn anything new from the crystal? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00009=Those classified documents we found on Korhal weren't anything special. Just referred to some old bio-weapons lab orbiting Castanar.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00011=Something I wish I hadn't seen. You remember that zerg-protoss hybrid at the lab we raided? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00014=You ain't gonna believe this, but I just saw Zeratul on the ship.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00015=Ah. How much did you have to drink tonight, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00016=[Angry 70]He was here, Matt. And he was hurt,[/Angry] on the run from something.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00018=[Fear 50]I don't know. But he ain't on this ship anymore. He gave me an Ihan memory crystal and he was desperate for me to study it. [/Fear]I guess he wants me to see what he's seen.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00019=Hard to forget. That thing was an abomination.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00020=Well Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he had to a... temple? Library? Kinda both I guess. A hybrid had already taken over the place. [Fear 70]Just how many of these things are out there?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00021=There's no way we can stop an alien invasion with one capital ship and a handful of volunteers. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00022=Are you alright, sir? Confronting Kerrigan again after all these years...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00023=We've gotta' stop her Matt... no matter what she's after.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00024=Well, we gave her a setback today. The artifacts are obviously important to her, I just wish we knew why.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00031=I've been looking for an encryption expert so we can access the adjutant we recovered. No luck so far.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00034=So, Matt, you planning another strike against Mengsk?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00036=Colonel Orlan at Deadman's Port can crack anything... Haven't been back there in awhile. [Happy 70]Say, didn't you end up gettin' married last time we were there?[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00037=I told you before - If I knew what the prize was, I never woulda' joined that card game!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00038=There's just something about a lovers' reunion that chokes me up.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00039=(sighs)
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00047=Just how bad is it, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00048=Zerg are attacking all over the sector, sir. Mengsk pulled the fleet back to protect the Dominion core-worlds, leaving the fringe worlds to fend for themselves. It's a nightmare.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00049='Best we just stay clear, partner. [Happy 70]We can earn ourselves a fortune working for Moebius while this whole thing blows over.[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00050=Zeratul was looking for more clues about the end of the universe -- but this time he was on Aiur.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00052=You don't get it, convict - this isn't gonna just 'blow over'! The zerg won't stop until we're all dead! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00056=Not just yet, sir. I figured we need to focus on the zerg first. Overthrowing Mengsk won't mean anything if we can't beat them.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00057=True. Freedom ain't worth squat if Kerrigan kills us all, that's for sure. Guess Mengsk can wait. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00058=Don't worry, Matt - we ain't sittin' this one out. But we're not exactly in tip top shape either. We'll earn some cash and build up our forces so we can make a difference when it counts.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00060=It sure felt good rescuin' those folks, but there's millions more out there that need help too.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00061=How we doin' up here, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00069=Most days... I don't even know what I'm doin' anymore. Just chasing my damn tail.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00070=No. We've followed your lead from the start. It's your sense of justice that's kept us on this road.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00071=Matt, my interest in justice burned out a long time ago. I've spent my whole life fighting; I've killed, I've ordered good men to their deaths - and for what? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00072=That's because you gave us something to believe in, sir. I'll never give up the fight. That's a promise.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00073=Every time we help folks in need it's another step on the road to a better future.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00074=Good to see you, sir. All available missions are ready for your perusal on the star map.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00075=Matt... I. Hell, just thanks, I guess.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00078=Welcome back, sir. What did you discover from the crystal this time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00082=I know, sir. I won't let you down. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00083=Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00084=(beat) It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00085=(beat) Finishing this thing with Mengsk... it's all I have left. It's guys like you that'll build something better after all the smoke clears.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00086=Sir, I have to question your objectivity on this alliance. It's obviously a trap!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00090=I got it covered, Matt. I'm askin' you to trust me.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00092=You signed up to follow my orders! If you can't do that anymore then get the hell off my ship! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00093=Good man. This truce won't last forever - just long enough to get the job done.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00094=But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00095=[Sad 50]Mengsk turned out to be a ruthless dictator... but that shouldn't automatically condemn his son. [/Sad]I've followed you through hell and back, sir - I'm not quitting on you now.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00096=You still got a problem with us working alongside Valerian?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00097=How long was I down in the lab, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00098=You've been gone for hours, sir. You've been in the lab all that time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00099=I used the Ihan crystal Zeratul gave me. I'd swear it only lasted a few minutes... So vivid... Zeratul's been searching for a Xel'Naga prophecy about the end of the universe. There's more, I just haven't got to it yet.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00100=Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00101=With the platform down the zerg have stopped hammering us. We're finally gaining control of high orbit. [Fear 70]But, sir - this last step  are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00102=I didn't sign up for this.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00103=It's that obvious I used it, huh? Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he found to a... temple? Library? Kinda both, I guess. But this weird protoss-zerg hybrid had taken over the place. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00104=You mean some sort of infested protoss?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00105=No, this wasn't like infestation at all. It was like someone took the strengths of both races and twisted them together. I gotta tell you - if these things are real, we're in a lot of trouble.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00106=Damn, Matt. I don't even know what to make of this last vision from the crystal.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00107=Aiur? What was he looking for?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00108=He was trying to find out why the Overmind made the Queen of Blades in the first place.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00109=She's the one that's going to destroy the universe?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00110=No, that's just it - I think she's the only one that can save it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00111=You look shaken, sir. What's wrong?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00112=Zeratul called it a vision of the future. It was the end times, Matt. Armageddon. More protoss than we ever knew existed, but there still weren't enough to stop the hybrid.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00113=But what about Kerrigan? Wasn't she supposed to stop them?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00114=In this time-line she was dead. Killed by...us. That's what Zeratul's been trying to tell us all along. She has to live or we're all doomed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00115=Sir.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00116=We were starting to make real progress against Mengsk. If we go after the Queen of Blades, we're throwing that away!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00117=It's a mess, sir. We're barely holding our orbital positions. Zerg fliers are pounding the hell out of us and Warfield's force is barely holding the landing zone. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00118=I know you're doing the best you can. Just keep things together and we'll make it through this. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00119=This is bigger than Mengsk. Matt, if we succeed on Char, we'll save billions of lives. Billions.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00120=I know taking out those Nydus canals left y'all in the lurch up here... I'm sorry for that. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00121=You did what you had to do, sir. [Fear 70]But this last step - are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?  [/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00122=(beat)It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00123=But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00124=How are things looking, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00125=Sir, when Tychus came back aboard the ship, I had the techs run a scan on him.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00126=Matt, you need to get a hobby.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00127=Seriously Sir -- his suit contains a sophisticated transponder... if it receives the correct code, it'll shut down all his major organs. That suit is a death trap.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00128=(stunned) He's got a gun to his head.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00129=On a personal note, nice job with Tychus. That ass-kicking's been a long time coming.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00131=Your better future needs to hurry up an' get here or there's gonna be no one left to see it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00132=And who's got their finger on the trigger? Moebius?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00133=Tychus, what have you gotten yourself into?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00134=Where is he now, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00135=Mengsk can wait.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00136=I think this one might be different. The files suggest they were planning to terminate everyone who ever worked there.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00137=I assume that doesn't mean 'firing' them... But why would Mengsk wanna' kill a whole research staff?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00138=I don't know, but it seems like something we should check out.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00139=It does, indeed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00140=What do you make of that encrypted message,  Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00141=I honestly don't know, Sir. If Tosh really is one of these Spectres, it's clear Mengsk would try to ruin your partnership. But Tosh isn't telling us everything. If we're going to win this revolution...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00142=I know... we have to be sure of our allies.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00143=If any of Dr. Hanson's people on Haven are infested...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00144=I know -- it's just a matter of time before the protoss come looking for them. (beat) Still, I have a history with the protoss. If it comes to that, maybe I can talk 'em down.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Group00001=Tosh
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Group00005=After TTosh01
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00001=I'll think about it. For the time being - welcome aboard the Hyperion. We'll talk later.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00002=Yeah I got another job for us on a world called Bel'Shir. Interested?
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00006=Why are you here, Tosh? Our business is done unless ya got something else for me?
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00008=Everyone knows Jim Raynor wants to put the hurt on Mengsk. I can help you with that...I can help you big time.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00011=Maybe. But what's in it for me? Piracy ain't exactly my chosen path.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00025=Ah here's the man! We make a good team, me and you.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Comment00001=Tychus does not appear on the bridge after TTychus05, storywise this one is a Valerian mission.

Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00001=Speaking of tight spots, Tychus - why are you still wearing that suit on my bridge?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00002=Yeah - what, did you bust the zipper or something?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00003=So are ya thinking about giving up this life of luxury and becoming a professional broadcaster?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00004=Ok, so I might've had a little help when I broke out of prison. Let's just say it came at a price. I get to stay locked up in this suit 'til I pay off all my debts...
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00005=Aw, regular folk just ain't ready for the raw sex appeal I'd unleash into their grey little lives. I reckon my niche is right here with you, ol' buddy. Right to the end.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00006=I'm glad you're part of all this, Tychus. You did real good today.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00011=I said I can handle it! If you don't want to be a part of this, you can take your thirty percent and go.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00013=(to Tychus) Your debts better not bite us in the ass, Tychus. Coverin' for your shenanigans ain't part of the deal.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00015=I been thinking about Tyrador, and you know - there's gotta be better ways to make a fast buck than divin' headlong into an alien invasion.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00016=Just watch your back, ol' buddy. That's all I'm askin'.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00022=One helluva ship y'got here, Jimmy. How'd you get a hold of a floating palace like this?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00023=The Hyperion was Mengsk's flagship back in the day. Me and Matt decided to 'borrow' her when we parted company with him. This old baby's seen us through some tight spots. 
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00024=If it gets too hairy for ya', just try and think of the money.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00025=I'm trying, old buddy. I'm trying real hard.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00030=And who's collectin' those debts? Who sprung you?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00033=Them Moebius boys, of course. I didn't just run into them in a museum, y'know. They want them artifacts somethin' fierce.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00038=You sure about this? You gotta know Mengsk is gunnin' for ya. He'll hit you in a way you'll never see coming.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00039=I can handle Mengsk, Tychus.

Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00002=By the way, Sir - you can probably find Tychus in the cantina.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00003=You can find Dr Hanson in the lab, Sir.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00004=Tosh is down in the cantina, Sir.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00005=Sir? Dr Hanson asked to talk to you about that protoss crystal you left in the lab.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00006=Sir? Stetmann has been asking about that protoss crystal you left in the lab.

Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00055=Bad-asses like us deserve a little down-time. I know...

Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00004=Don't go believing that little girl's lies. The Spectre procedure affects everyone differently, but we're all still human. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00006=It's our choice whether to become Spectres - not hers, not yours and not Mengsk's. Choice be the only true freedom anyone gets.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00007=But can I trust 'em? Can I trust you?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00010=Don't you worry none. We'll fight for you right to the end. All my brothers and sisters - we owe you everything.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00011=(Chuckles) He's a bad, bad man that Tychus. He got a lot to hide.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00012=I heard about what went down in the lab. Pity that. But don't let yourself get distracted from what has to be done. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00013=Sometimes I feel like anything I start caring about... just gets destroyed.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00015=What do ya' think of Dr. Hanson?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00016=Not your fault. Did you ever stop and think what'd happen if all those refugees from Agria had gone to the core worlds? That Hanson was a honey trap right from the start. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00018=You think he's setting us up? His missions have been leading us straight to Kerrigan...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00019=Maybe you and Kerrigan keeping runnin' into each other because you both want the same thing? But Tychus - there's something else he don't want you to know. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00020=(beat) I can't see what. Just watch your back. Always remember that he's a force o' destruction that one... a stone killer.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00021=She's a lovely thing. Full o' honey, that one. At least that's what she want you to think.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00022=You think she's hiding something?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00023=You ever wonder why the zerg hit her world so fast? Something there they want. Something made o' honey maybe? Buzzin' little bees...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00024=I been keepin' my ear to the ground for you, and I hear a whisper. Seems Mengsk is plannin' to use alien technology to stop the zerg.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00033=Ah, here's my man. How can I be helping you, Mr. Raynor?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00040=Still don't trust me, brother? Until you decide, ain't nothing to discuss.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00041=You sit up here watching everything. Tell me what you see. Tychus just a mean drunk?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00042=You look... haunted. You've been seein' into the spirit world, and you learned somethin' you don't like. It's... Kerrigan?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00043=I saw... a hybrid. Something unnatural. It was trying to corrupt the protoss preservers. Who would have sent it there? Who controls something like that?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00044=But is it cast in stone? That's what I need to know.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00045=Who knows? I've heard you say we are who we choose to be. If that be true, the future cannot be fixed.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00046=Seems the Overmind made Kerrigan to... free the zerg... from somethin'. Put 'em on a collision course with the protoss.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00047=Zerg... protoss. These are strong races. How terrible - how powerful - is something that plays with their fates?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00048=It's all gone wrong. Everything's... twisted, and there's something out there that's set to destroy us all.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00054=I wish it was just that. All that jealousy and rage - he's fighting himself over something he don't want to do. You'll see. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00076=Had any... visitors... lately? 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00077=Oh I think you do, 'James Raynor'. Something was on this ship just now. (sniffs) I still smell it on you. (sniffs again) Protoss...interestin'...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00078=Whatever you think you know, you just keep it to yourself. I hear you yappin' about this and I'll toss you out the airlock! 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00094=Good to see ya', brotha'. I been - wait. I can see it in your eyes. You've seen into the spirit world... The protoss. He gave you ... a crystal! And now you've been seein' what he's seen.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00095=That ain't nothing to do with you. Stay outta my head, Tosh!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00096=Have it your way. But you want to tread careful when you go lookin' into the beyond. If you need me, you know where I be.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00099=You look spooked. You've been seein' what the protoss has to show you. The memories shine through you as clear as day.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00101=The one that made them, for sure. That was just the first of many. Dark harbingers, man. Soon they'll be beyond numbering - an' the stars will weep at what comes after.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00102=How could you know all this?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00103=I don't. I just feel it be true. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00104=(amused) What've you been seein' this time, man? (sober) Wait...I see it too. Kerrigan?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00110=Damn, brotha' - you look like you could use a drink.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00111=I saw the last vision Zeratul put into the crystal. It was a look into the future - a final battle against the hybrid. Armageddon. Somehow... Kerrigan's the key to preventing it.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00112=Who knows how the wheel turns? Cycles upon cycles. This much I know - Those that see the future best take heed. It's both a gift... and a curse. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00115=So that's why he's collecting up artifacts!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00116=Maybe. Could be why Kerrigan's chasing them too. She may not want them for herself, but she'll stop anyone else from getting to them.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00117=Take my advice - keep it simple. No attachments, no strings. Just you against the universe.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00126=Ever wonder why Mengsk don't just send him Ghosts to kill you? You've been a thorn in his side for a long time.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00127=Assassinating me'd just turn me into a martyr. (chuckles) He'd never be rid of me then. He needs to kill my reputation first. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00128=Very good. You think clearly despite your hate for him. 'Course his patience has got limits too. Tread careful, Mr. Raynor. Someone on this ship is already working for Mengsk. I can feel it. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00132=Whatever you found down there makes me afraid. What was it?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00133=Something monstrous - a zerg-protoss hybrid. It must've been a powerful psi for you to feel its scream from all the way up here. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00134=Searing. Blinding. Like feelin' the sun burning your face with your eyes squeezed shut. I never felt a thing like that before. I hope I never do again.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00135=Must be hard, man, seeing the Queen o' blades out in the world again. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00136=How much do you know about Kerrigan, Tosh?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00137=I had some... friends in the Ghost Academy. That girl was a legend even before she disappeared from the program. There's a few that know the truth... how the Queen of Blades came to be. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00138=She's a creature of pure rage now.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00139=Oh yes - it's her or us. If we don't kill her she'll slaughter us all.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00140=I don't know what you're talking about, Tosh.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Comment00006=Raynor gets up and walks away. Tychus watches him go... then looks down at his drink. Whatever was eating him up... it's still there.

Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00002=I used to think Mengsk'd be a force for change. I fought alongside him right up until Tarsonis. That's where he crossed the line by using zerg to murder the whole planet. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00003=Nothin' says I can't do my part for humanity and get paid well for my trouble.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00004=Right.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00005=He left Kerrigan there to die 'cause she called him out on it. Turned out he was just as rotten as the Confederacy ever was.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00006=Damn. You sure know how to pick your friends, Jimmy. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00009=You meet Dr. Hanson yet?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00010=Sure did. I asked that sweet thing if she'd like to give me a physical. No harm in askin', right? I think she's got her eye on some pansy-ass though.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00013=Yeah? Who might that be?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00014=(sarcastic) Oh I dunno, some white knight kinda guy, came charging down to save her colony, maybe? Damn, Jimmy - you never could read the ladies.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00015=You ready to tell me what the hell that was all about?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00016=Man, these last few weeks... helpin' you fight the good fight - I finally got a taste of what real freedom is.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00017=Then what was all that talk earlier about doin' humanity a favor and getting paid well in the process?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00019=But that's all comin' to an end with you chargin' off like some damn hero - for a cause I couldn't care less about.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00020=Heh. You just let me know when I can take it out for another spin!
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00021=You ever heard of a guy named Gabriel Tosh?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00022=Robbing a train again get ya' feelin' nostalgic? 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00024=Only rumors. Way I hear it, he was mixed up in some covert branch of the Ghost program that produced some real scary bad-asses. Word was Tosh snapped and went rogue. I'd play it real cool with that kind. He'd cut your throat soon as look 'atcha.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00025=Your Moebius buddies ever happen to mention that the Queen of Blades wants these artifacts too?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00026=Hey, they just give me the missions, man. What's it matter anyway? Puttin' that bitch down would be doin' everyone a favor...
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00027=I've dealt with rogue Ghosts before. It's the ones still working for Mengsk I got a problem with.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00029=That Tosh is a whack job, Jimmy! Spends all his time muttering and playing around with those damn... dolls of his.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00030=Well, I need someone to balance out your sophistication and good manners.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00033=The guy ain't right in the head, brother! I can appreciate some good, honest craziness. But that guy? He's got something broke inside.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00035=So how does the Odin rate as a fighting machine?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00037=Brother... it is the single greatest creation in the history of mankind. Stridin' around and dispensin' righteous fury just about brought a tear to my eye. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00038=Damn straight. We musta hit the Shale Express a dozen times back in the day. (chuckles) [Happy] Ah, that caper never got old.[/Happy]
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00039=Almost got us killed when they smartened up and started using outriders to chase us.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00040=You'll get your chance soon enough, ol' buddy. Don't you worry.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00041=Never was a man of 'em could keep up with you on a Vulture, Jimmy. Just added to the fun. How the hell you got a job as marshal after all that I'll never know.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00042=That little Nova chick was somethin' else. You ever think about hittin' that, Jimmy?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00045=Damn shame Doc Hanson stayed behind. She was just about to fall for my roguish charms too. You ain't gonna tell me you weren't just a little bit tempted to stay with her, are ya?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00046=Heh. That girl's nothin' but trouble, Tychus. She's got her hands full hunting down the rest of Tosh's psychopathic Spectres. Best just to stay out of her way.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00047=That wasn't no answer. All these missed opportunities... There's something very wrong with you, man.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00050=I been down that road before, Tychus. I took my shot at a normal life a long time ago. Ain't no going back now. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00051=Huh. Couple of badasses like us ain't cut out for the quiet life anyway. Yes sir, destiny's got us pegged for something way bigger.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00053=Thought you'd want to hear - Tosh has officially thrown in with our little revolution. He's gonna lend us his Spectres to help out.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00054=You sure got a soft spot for wayward psychics, Jimmy. Settin' those freaks loose ain't smart. Ol' Mengsk had 'em locked up for a reason.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00055=Mengsk locked 'em up because they were just weapons to him. They deserve a shot at livin' their lives outside of a cage... just like anyone else.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00058=You gonna tell me 'I told ya so' - that we never shoulda gone to Agria in the first place?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00059=I ain't about to kick dirt on ya when yer down. Just some bad luck is all. Besides I'm sure your protoss buddies are real proud of you.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00060=It was our own mess to clean up. I don't give a damn what the protoss think.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00063=I thought it was just about the money with you, Tychus.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00067=How'd you become such good buddies with those freaky pro-toss? All I hear is they kill terrans like you and me on sight!
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00068=Some of 'em would. But some others would fight to the death protectin' people like us. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00071=I helped 'em defend their homeworld from the zerg during the first war. When Kerrigan came back leading the Swarm, I helped 'em out again. They're real big on loyalty.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00073=Damn Jimmy, almost sounds like you respect 'em. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00074=I wouldn't expect you to understand, Tychus. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00075='Just seems the closer we get to your Queen of Blades... well, let's just say things don't always work out the way ya' plan, Jimmy.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00079=I need ya with me on this one, Tychus. Trust me... for old times' sake.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00080=Alright. Alright, I'm with ya.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00082=That's my boy.

Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00007=Wait a second, you're talking about Kerrigan?
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00008=Time is short! You must understand!
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00009=It's been four years! Y'show up outta nowhere - 
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00010=Wha!
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00011=The answers you seek lie within. Study it well, the fate of creation hangs in the balance.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00012=...Nice to see you too. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Group00001=Terran04AB Tychus Intro
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00001=Y'know, for the most wanted man in the sector - you ain't that hard to find.
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00002=I had to see it for myself. Little Jimmy Raynor... the people's hero.
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00003=(recognizing) Tychus Findlay... 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00004=(sarcastic) Nice suit. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00005=Pays to be prepared. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00006=I heard they put you on ice. Life sentence. (sarcastic) What, did they give you time off for good behavior?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00007=That's right, old buddy. I'm a model citizen now. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00008=(laughs) So to what do I owe the pleasure?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00009=Just a friendly business proposition. Do you even know what the Dominion are doing out here?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00010=I'm guessin' yer about to tell me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00011=Digging up alien artifacts, old buddy. Your boy Mengsk has gone crazy for 'em. But I got a contact that'll pay top dollar for every artifact we...liberate from the Dominion.
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00012=I guess I can hardly pass that up, now can I, Tychus?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00013=Partners then. Sixty-forty. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00014=Seventy-thirty. My way. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00015=(laughs) Feels like old times already! 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00016=Old Times. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Group00001=Terran 05 - Horner/Bridge Intro
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00001=Damn Jimmy, you've been holding out on me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00002=Cuttin it pretty close there, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00003=Never left you hanging before, sir. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00004=Fair enough. Just get us the hell outta here! 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00005=All batteries, concentrate forward firepower.  Spin up drives two and six!  All hands brace for warp jump on my mark!
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00008=Mark! 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00009=What the hell happened? We ain't seen the zerg in years  - why attack Mar Sara now? 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00010=It's not just Mar Sara. You need to see this. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00011=-Zerg swarm launched a full scale attack-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00012=-Devastation spread throughout all outer rim planets-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00013=-Sustained heavy losses-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00014=-Casualties in the billions-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00015=-Minutes ago the zerg attacked a Dominion military research facility-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00016=Sweet mother of mercy. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00017=-New, exclusive video footage confirms the Queen of Blades is in fact leading the swarm!
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00018=We always knew she'd be back. (beat) But what's she after? 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00019=She's come to finish the job. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Group00001=Terran 06 - Valerian Intro
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00001=Sir, we've reached the rendezvous coordinates. No contacts. Looks like the Moebius ship hasn't arrived yet.   
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00002=That's strange. It ain't like them to be late. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00003=Sir! Dominion ships warping in! Mengsk's flagship is leading them! 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00004=Sweet mother of mercy. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00005=Matt - pull us alongside and prep docking tubes! 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00006=Commander, this is not a smart move. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00007=You wanted your revolution, kid. Now ya got it. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00008=Turn around, Arcturus! I want you to see this coming. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00009=You won't find my father here, Commander. I am Valerian Mengsk - and I own the Moebius Foundation... through them, I own you as well.
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00010=Tell me why I shouldn't kill you right now...
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00011=Because I can offer you what you've always wanted -- a chance to rescue Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00012=Sir, their shields are still down. (decisive) I don't like this.
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Group00001=Terran 07 - Bar Fight
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00001=You boys gotta wake up! Raynor sold us out! I joined this outfit to fight the Dominion, not work for 'em!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00002=Everybody simmer down! We trusted the commander before - we should trust him now! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00003=(drunk)  You can't trust that drunk. Jim Raynor's nothing but a spineless coward!  
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00004=You been nothin' but poison since you got on this crate. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00005=That right!? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00006=Pathetic. Only person you can trust is yourself! The sooner you peons figure that out-- 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00007='Heard about enough of this!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00008=Aaah! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00009=You got 'em all fooled, don't ya, Jimmy? But the first sign of trouble - you'll just duck and run. It's what you do ain't it? Me... them... that pretty little girlfriend of yours... 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00010=Raaaaawr! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00012=Don't do something you're gonna regret, Tychus! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00013=Rawr!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00014=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00015=That.... Ain't... fair...
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00016=You think he's right? That I'm just gonna run out on ya? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00017=You've got us working for the Dominion now, Commander. Taking us back to Char? It's like you're gone already. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00018=This ain't about the Dominion. Our war's always been about savin' lives. If the zerg wipe everyone out, it's all been for nothing. So I'm going to back to Char. If you're with me, it's your choice. Just like it's always been. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00019=Now that's the commander I've been waiting on. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00020=(to crew) Satisfied? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00021=Let's get back to work, boys. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00022=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00023=I don't wanna have to have this conversation again. (beat) And fix my damn jukebox! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00024=Uhh... a little help here? ...Anybody...? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00025=Rawr!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00026=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00027=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Group00001=Terran 08 - Hanson A end
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00001=So I guess this is goodbye, Doc. I know you got a lot of cleaning up to do out there. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00002=We'll manage somehow. I just hope you boys stay out of trouble. Those protoss are bound to be upset. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00003=Well, me and the protoss go way back. I've helped them out a few times... Figure they might cut me some slack. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00004=You know, you could always stay here. Settle down, make a new start... 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00005=(laughs) Guys like me don't get second chances, darlin'. We just gotta finish what we begun.  
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00006=You're a good man, Jim Raynor. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00007=Hmph. I ain't that good. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Group00001=Terran 09 - Tosh A end
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00001=Fifty years and no-one's ever escaped from New Folsom... but we broke it open in an afternoon. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00002=I can hardly believe we pulled it off. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00003=You guys did good. Now me and my spectres'll finish the job, we'll kill Mengsk and burn his Dominion to the ground. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00004=Overthrowing Mengsk is just the start. This is about building a better tomorrow. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00005=Don't you see? We just released every scientist, philosopher, and free thinker that ever challenged Mengsk's rule. That was our real victory today.
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00006=You really that naive? Tomorrow there'll be a new Mengsk and another one after that. Your great, shining dream of the future is just an illusion. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00007=So if it's all so bleak why are you here, Tosh? What do you get out of all this? 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00008=Same thing as you, brother! I don't quit till Mengsk is dead. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00009=Vengeance doesn't factor into this. Our revolution's about freedom. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00010=You'll see that better future, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00011=But it ain't for the likes of us. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Group00002=Terran 10 - Raynor's Dream
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00008=I've been cleaning up after you a lot lately. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00009=Leave it alone, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00010=Same dream? 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00011=I said leave it alone. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00012=What happened to Kerrigan wasn't your fault...
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00013=Which part? Where she got left behind, [Angry]or where she murdered eight billion people.[/Angry]
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00014=Same old bullshit. You ain't going to listen. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00015=Man, do you even see what you're becoming? 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00016=We are who we chose to be, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00017=When you figure it out let us know. We're waitin' on ya.

Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00003=Huh-ah.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00004=General. You know I've always got a card to play. 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00005=Huah!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00006=You might be a damn pirate, Raynor, but whatever happens you saved my boys today and I won't forget that.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00007=All in a day's work, General.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00008=Shit!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00009=Ungh!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00010=Ungh!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00015=Aaah!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00016=Gah! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00018=- Fall back! - We're cut off! - 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00019=Belay that order! Stand your ground! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00021=Huff! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00024=Grah. 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00025=Ain't no time to be lyin' down on the job, General.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00026=(chuckles) Heard you boys needed some help. We came as fast as we could.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00027=You magnificent son of a bitch! You're the last man I expected to see! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00028=Boys...I hate to interrupt but...the natives are gettin' restless.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00029=Thanks for the rescue...But I hope it ain't just the two of you...

Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Group00001=Terran 12 - Horner Victory
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00001=Y'know I love seeing him squirm, but the Dominion's just going to spin this like they do everything else.
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00002=Not this time. Mengsk used the media as a weapon for years, now we've turned it against him. One broadcast and it won us a bigger victory than a hundred battles. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00004=I guess you're right, well it's what we started this revolution for in the first place....We've got a long way to go, but maybe we started something here. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00005=Hearts and minds man, just like you always said. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00006=Y'know Matt, someday you're going to wind up leading this bunch of misfits. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00007=Oh, no... that's what I keep you around for...sir. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00008=....these shocking revelations...
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00009=...of anti-Mengsk sentiment...
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00010=... the Emperor held a news conference earlier today: 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00011=Emperor - how do you respond to these allegations of genocide! Of using aliens to-- 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00012= I assure you, these slanderous attacks against the throne are baseless and irresponsible!
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00013=Sir, do you still stand by the sentiment that selfless devotion to the people is the basis of your rule?
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00014=Well, of course! I was called upon to serve the greater interest of humanity! Personal power was never my goal!
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00015=Then how would you characterize this statement?
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00016=...I will not be stopped. Not by you or the Confederates or the protoss or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me....
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00017=(roars) I...I won't STAND for this! You jackals think you can come in here and question ME?! This interview is OVER! 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00018={Laughs}

Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00001=Ariel! You in here? 
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00002=Matt, seal all access points.
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00003=Rawr!  
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00004=Oh, God - not you, too... 
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00005=Will you enjoy killing me ...like you killed my children?
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00007=You're infested...You're dead already.
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00008=Do... it... finish... it...  
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00009=What is it with the women in my life?  
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00011=Will you enjoy it?
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Group00001=Terran 14 - Tosh B end
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00001=Transmission coming in - it's Tosh. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00002=Didn't take long for him to gloat, patch him through. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00003=You gonna pay for that man - 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00004=Is that supposed to be me? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00005=- you gonna regret crossing me... 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00006=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00007=Huh? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00008=You're a scumbag Tosh - 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00009= - I've spent my whole life fighting men like you. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00010=Aaaahh!
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00011=Hah, you and me, we're just the same. We'd both do anything to get the job done. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00012=No. You don't get it at all. And now you never will.
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00013=What you gonna do man? I'm six light years away! 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00014=Not me...
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00015=Hmm. Cold and efficient. Reminds me of someone I used to know. Glad you're not after me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00016=Not today anyway - I'll see you around Jim.
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00017=Don't you ever meet any normal girls? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00018=Aaaahh!
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00019=Arrrrrggh! 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Group00001=Terran 15 - Kerrigan Intro
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00001=That's funny, convict, I don't recall giving you access to our database. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00002=Just keeping up on current events, 'captain'.  Seems this 'Queen of Blades' got everybody running scared. She don't look so tough.
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00004=You have no idea who she is, do you, Tychus? 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00005=Don't matter to me none. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00006=Well it matters to Jim. They were...close once. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00007=...Wait a minute...(chuckles) you're tellin' me they  were shacked up?! 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00008=(sighs) Apparently she was something else... Before the zerg took her. Turned her into that.
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00009=And Jimmy feels responsible. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00010=Honestly, if we have to face her again I don't know what he'll do. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00011=Woman like that...there's only one thing to do.

Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Group00001=Terran 17 - Char invasion
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00001=Char. If Hell ever existed - this is it. Oceans of fire, tectonic storms and an atmosphere that'll burn a man alive. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00002=But we've planned for all of that- 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00003=You can't plan for the zerg, general. They ain't goin' to fit in to your nice, clean time table. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00004=I've led five separate invasions against the swarm. I held the line while you and your terrorist friends hid under a rock.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00005=We're all aware of your victories, General. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00006=I've invited Commander Raynor here to assist us with any unforeseen contingencies. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00007=Well it sounds like you got it all figured out, junior. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00008=I have far too much invested in this undertaking to see it fail.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00009=Valerian! I've just received a report you've taken half the fleet! Care to explain yourself, boy? 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00010=Father, I am about to accomplish that which you never could. Today I will defeat the Queen of Blades and secure peace throughout the Dominion. By this act the people will finally know that I am a worthy successor to you. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00011=I love your gumption, son, but you're in way over your head. What makes you think you have the experience to- 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00012=He ain't alone, Arcturus! 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00013=[Surprise]Raynor. [/Surprise]I don't know what gutter my son fished you out of, but even you've got to realize that treacherous bitch cannot be saved... And neither can you.  
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00014=We'll see about that, and when this is over, you and me got a score to settle. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00016=Everything I could have hoped for... 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00017=You're playing a dangerous game here, kid - 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00018=Prince Valerian, we have zerg attack waves incoming. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00019=Already? 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00020=Clear the bridge! I've got a battle to win.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00021=I'll see you boys on the ground. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00022=Speaking of which, you might particularly enjoy this next step.

Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00002=Well, we'll see how long that lasts. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00003=Heh.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00004=I brought you boys a present. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00005=The Xel'Naga artifact's been assembled. I hope to God it does what we think it does. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00006=Damn straight. Bettin' our asses on some alien piece of crap don't sit right with me.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00007=I hear ya, Tychus. But if I was bankin' everything on that I'd be quit already. 'Cause here we are in the mouth of hell, an' we made it this far by leanin' on each other.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00008=Whether it's blind luck or damn-fool courage - in all my years, I've never seen anything like what you two jokers have pulled off.

Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00011=...the one thing I know - is that we can count on each other to get the job done.

Conversation/Debriefs/Comment00005=Takes place in cantina
Conversation/Debriefs/Comment00006=--- These next lines are playback from Terran 8 in SC1. As these lines play we cut to Raynor's face  (with a slow push in) as he listens, shocked and cut back to the adjutant to show her speaking in different voices.  Probably need to script this and get some fine-tuned FaceFX work for Raynor.
Conversation/Debriefs/Comment00007=STATIC as if a 2nd recording is spliced onto the end.

Conversation/Debriefs/Line00001=Well, I like this guy already. Just the same, we'd best keep an eye on him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00002=Well, old girl, we dug you up on Tarsonis. Were you online during the zerg attack? You remember anything about Arcturus Mengsk bein' involved? 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00003=Mengsk. Arcturus. Ex-Confederate officer. Civilian Prospector. Founder and leader of the Sons of Korhal terrorist group. Status. Criminal.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00004=And you were gonna tell me all this when?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00009=Now Mengsk hates him almost as much as he hates you.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00010=You're the only man who's been close to her and lived to tell the tale. You know her tactics, you know her strategies - and I know you'd risk anything for the chance to bring her back.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00012=Sir, tell me you're not seriously considering this deal with Valerian!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00013=Sounds like a golden deal to me, Jimmy. Kerrigan turns human, takes a bullet between the eyes... You can put your past to rest and still make one hell of a payday!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00014=Nice work, sir. The payoff from Redstone really got us back on our feet.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00015=Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Tychus...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00016=Accessing intercepted transmission 0081 to 0086 Alpha.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00017=Why is that Tosh guy aboard?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00018=He wanted to talk to you in person, sir. Something about conducting more 'business ventures' together.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00019=You do any diggin' on him?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00020=Of course, and he's no pirate. Rumor has it he's a renegade Ghost - and until he vanished he was one of the Dominion's top assassins.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00021=Great to have ya', Doc. How you plannin' on pitchin' in?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00022=Great job, sir. Dr. Hanson's offered to stay on with us for now and I think her skills will be invaluable.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00023=Well, your medical facilities are medieval and your science expertise is non-existent. Perhaps I could start there?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00024=[Sad 90]Ouch.[/Sad] Well I guess you might be able to teach Stetmann a thing or two. Welcome aboard, Doc.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00025=It's hard to believe I'm even here.  
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00028=This is Duke. The Emitters are secured and online.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00029=Who authorized the use of Psi Emitters?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00030=I did, Lieutenant.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00031=Sir, I received an encrypted transmission from an untraceable source.  It claims that Tosh here was part of a classified operation called Project: Shadowblade. They used jorium and terrazine to enhance ghost powers.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00032=There's no telling what the zerg will throw against us this time. Sir, we need to make sure our hardware and munitions are up to the challenge.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00033=Yeah, I'll check in with Swann down in the armory. Knowin' him, he's already got upgrades for us. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00034=The artifact fragments you've been collecting are of Xel'Naga origin. With them, I can construct a device that will reverse the infestation that transformed Kerrigan into the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00035=Even if that were possible, she holes up in the main hive cluster on Char - protected by a billion screaming zerg. How're you going to get that thing anywhere near her?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00036=Welcome back, sir. Glad you're still alive. Prince Valerian's been trying to contact you. You can reach him over the communicator. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00038=Well, you fought real good out there, Tychus. Your time in the freezer didn't dull your edge none. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00039=Well, fear and violence always did bring out the best in me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00040=Have to admit, we always did make a good team.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00041=Yeah, well - that was until I went to prison... and you went legit.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00042=Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00043=What? The Confederates on Antiga were bad enough, but now you're going to use the Zerg against an entire planet? This is insane.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00044=She's right, man. Think this through. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00045=I have thought it through, believe me. You all have your orders. Carry them out.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00046=I will not be stopped. Not by you or the Confederates or the protoss or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00047=Holy... I can't believe it! We can nail Mengsk to the wall with this!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00049=Talk to me, you old piece of junk. What do you know?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00050=User identified. Raynor. James. Ex-marshal, Mar Sara colony. Joined. Sons of Korhal terrorist group. Status. Criminal.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00051=Enough about me, darlin'. What else you got locked up in that synthetic head of yours?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00052=User status. Criminal. Access denied.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00053=Playin' hard to get, huh? We'll see about that. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00054=Assaulting Char is a suicide mission! You'd be putting all our lives on the line just to get your girlfriend back!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00055=This is bigger than all of us, Matt!  It ain't about me. This is the only real chance we're ever gonna' get. And I'm takin' it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00056=So which is it gonna be, Jimmy? We bringin' Kerrigan back... or puttin' her in the ground?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00057=That's for me to decide. (beat) You've both got a lot of prep work to do -- get to it!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00058=I hate to ask, sir -- but is there a reason that convict's still on my bridge?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00059=Easy, Matt. Tychus is one of my oldest friends. He helped me out of a real bind a few years back. I owe him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00060=Well your friend has a criminal record as long as...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00061=Mine? Believe me, if Tychus Findlay wanted me dead, I'd be dead already.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00062=(Not liking it) Understood, sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00063=I caught Tychus hacking into our database, sniffing around about Kerrigan. I don't know what his game is, but we clearly can't trust him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00064=Matt, me an' Tychus ran together a long time -- got into all sorts of trouble. When the law finally caught up, he took the rap for both of us. Never once ratted me out. (beat) I got a second chance, he got locked up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00065=I understand your loyalty, sir, but ---
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00066=I owe him, Matt. Leave it be.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00067=Yes Sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00068=Yes sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00069=Sir, that adjutant we recovered is down in the lab. She's all powered up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00070=Sir, the decrypted adjutant is back in the lab, and ready to go.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00071=Nova transmitted the Ghost training specs to us sir. We should be able to field our own Ghosts now.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00072=If Mengsk finds out, she's gonna have some explainin' to do.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00073=I think she can cover her tracks. That's what Ghosts do, right?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00074=That, and cut people's throats.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00075=Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00076=Friend Raynor, you now bear witness... to the truth. There is a malevolent presence within the Void that seeks to destroy everything we hold dear. Could this... Fallen One be a Xel'Naga? After so long... could the gods themselves seek our destruction?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00077=And Kerrigan... I can hardly believe -- the wretched Queen of Blades will prevent the destruction of all that we know...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00078=Raynor, you may soon hold Kerrigan's fate in your hands. I know only that she must live. Be wary, old friend... the hounds of the Void... are on the hunt.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00079=It's true. We are called Spectres -- next generation Ghosts.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00080=We all have our secrets, Mr. Raynor.  Doesn't mean I'm any threat to you.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00081=[Angry 50]Maybe not -- but whoever sent this message could be.[/Angry] Matt, any way to verify the transmission?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00082=No sir. But it does end with "I'll be in touch soon."
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00083=It's Mengsk - trying to turn us against each other. Don't let him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00084=I'll let it lie for now -- at least 'til I find out who sent this transmission. But I'll be keeping an eye on you, Tosh.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00085=Well Ariel, found a world for your people yet?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00086=Yes! An unclaimed planet called Haven. It's near the edge of protoss space, but it seems safe enough.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00087=It'll have to do. Your people need to lay low for a while.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00088=Aren't either of you worried the colonists might be infested?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00089=You can try.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00090=How could you even suggest that? They're perfectly healthy!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00091=I hope so, Ariel. The protoss don't mess around when it comes to infestation. Just in case, maybe you should start looking into some kind of cure for the zerg virus.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00092=Conventional wisdom says a cure is impossible -- the virus mutates too fast. But I'll look into it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00093=Just do what you can. That's all anyone's askin'.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00094=That thing down there, it was like the hybrid Zeratul fought.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00095=Here? But how?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00096=(ranting) Mengsk! It's always Mengsk! The end of the universe is coming and I should have known he'd be behind it! 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00097=But how did he hybridize zerg and protoss? The technology required is way beyond anything terrans have developed. He can't be working alone on this...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00098=What the hell is Mengsk playing at?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00099=Creating his own alien super-soldiers by the looks of it. He's found a way to hybridize zerg and protoss somehow.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00100=Don't look like he's house-broken 'em yet. Least the lab's been trashed.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00101=Yeah, but it was only one lab. Who's to say how many more he's set up?

Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00007=That was a rough mission. I can't believe you got the artifact!

Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00005=Better future. Let's hope that's what Ariel's people find on Haven.
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00006=I won't expect any gratitude from Nova. But I think we did the right thing by getting rid of Tosh.

Conversation/InstallerText/Group00001=Installer Text
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00001=Centuries ago four prison ships from Earth veered off course and journeyed deep into the remote Koprulu sector. There they crash-landed on the planets of Tarsonis, Moria, and Umoja.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00002=Cut off from Earth, the survivors established colonies throughout the sector. The largest, Tarsonis, was founded by a powerful yet increasingly oppressive government called the Confederacy.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00003=Spurred by the terrible acts of this government, Arcturus Mengsk formed the Sons of Korhal. This rebel army fought to overthrow the Confederacy and liberate the Koprulu sector.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00004=Even as Mengsk and his resistance fighters fought to overthrow the corrupt Confederacy, a much greater threat confronted the terrans.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00005=Without warning, massive alien warships appeared and surrounded the Confederate planet of Chau Sara. Calling themselves protoss, the aliens incinerated the planet's surface and then mysteriously withdrew.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00006=The planet had been infested by another type of alien: the zerg. These monstrous creatures threatened to overwhelm terran space, and the protoss sought to eradicate them before they spread.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00007=The zerg had already reached the neighboring planet, Mar Sara, and Marshal Jim Raynor fought to save the terrified colonists as the Confederate government abandoned them to the alien menace.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00008=The Sons of Korhal intervened, saving thousands of lives from the rampaging zerg and enigmatic protoss. Disgusted by the Confederacy, Raynor joined the rebels and met Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00009=Kerrigan was a former Confederate ghost operative, and she shared Raynor's desire for a liberated Koprulu sector. They grew close as the battle with the Confederacy escalated.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00010=But Mengsk went too far in his hatred and ambition. He ordered devices placed on the Confederate capital world of Tarsonis to lure the zerg and annihilate the population.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00011=The protoss, led by Executor Tassadar, decided to help the Terrans defeat the zerg instead of purging the planet of life. Mengsk sent Kerrigan to stop Tassadar's interference.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00012=With Kerrigan battling the protoss, the zerg overwhelmed Tarsonis and decimated the population. Having achieved his goals, Mengsk left the planet and abandoned Kerrigan to the aliens.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00013=Sickened by Mengsk's treachery, Raynor quit the Sons of Korhal. He raced to the planet's surface to save Kerrigan, but was too late: no trace of her remained.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00014=Having destroyed the Confederacy, Mengsk crowned himself emperor of the newly formed Terran Dominion; a government that would prove to be just as corrupt as its predecessor.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00015=Raynor mourned the loss of Kerrigan and vowed revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however, the zerg hadn't killed Kerrigan. Instead, they took her to the volcanic planet of Char.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00016=On Char, Kerrigan was transformed into the alien Queen of Blades. She became a being of immense psionic power, loyal to the Overmind, ruler of the zerg Swarm.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00017=Separate from Tassadar's forces, another protoss faction emerged from the shadows. Zeratul and his dark templar sought to end the zerg expansion through stealth and the power of the Void.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00018=The two protoss forces joined together against the Swarm, but the Overmind was able to discover their secret homeworld of Aiur. The zerg quickly invaded, and the Overmind embedded itself in the planet's surface.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00019=Zeratul taught Tassadar how to combine his powers with those of the Void.  Tassadar fused those energies into his ship, and crashed it into the gargantuan Overmind, destroying it utterly.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00020=Despite Tassadar's sacrifice, the protoss on Aiur were forced to seek refuge on the dark templar homeworld of Shakuras. With the Overmind destroyed, Kerrigan assumed control of the zerg.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00021=Raynor began a resistance movement against the oppressive Dominion. In retaliation, Mengsk deployed his greatest weapon -- propaganda -- to marginalize Raynor's efforts and paint him as a terrorist.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00022=It is now four years later. Kerrigan and the zerg have remained ominously silent. Meanwhile, the Dominion has grown in power and extended its influence throughout the Koprulu sector.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00023=Raynor and his forces, plagued by low morale and lack of resources, continue their struggle against the Dominion. Victory against Mengsk, however, seems more distant than ever....

Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00001=Hope that thing was worth all the effort. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00002=So we've transferred all the artifact pieces to Valerian's people?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00003=Yes, all gone. I'm sort of relieved to be honest, Commander. Working in here late at night was starting to -ah- you know, strain my scientific detachment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00004=Well it's down to the Moebius scientists to figure it all out now. I hope for their sake they get it right.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00005=Don't you mean for all our sakes?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00006=No, I was thinking more about how I'll hunt every one of them down if they screw this thing up.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00007=All that sweat and blood getting the artifacts... Now we've given them away to Valerian so he can build a super weapon to stop Kerrigan.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00008=Hell, this had better work or I'm just the dumbest jackass alive.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00009=Can you tell me anything about this artifact? I gotta admit... it kinda weirds me out.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00010=It really is fascinating, Commander. Preliminary analysis suggests that its energy signature radiates at ten times the magnitude of any previously recorded alien antiquities. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00011=Yeah, well -- don't start pickin' at it, Stetmann. With our luck, it'd probably just open up a black hole and swallow the ship....
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00012=Goodness, I hadn't factored the odds of that potentiality... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00013=Oh -- Commander, Commander, Commander. I've been giving these artifacts some thought...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00014=Oh -- don't worry -- I know what you're gonna say -- I haven't been running diagnostics on them or anything! Well, at least not directly, at any rate...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00015=Just spit it out, son.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00016=Well, sir -- when the second piece was added? The ambient containment field spiked drastically. Hm, I know. If we add any more pieces, we'll need to draw even more power from the ship's fusion core to maintain the field. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00017=So holding these things is dangerous and expensive. Well, the sooner we get 'em off my ship, the better.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00018=I'm pleased to see these things haven't blown up the ship... Yet.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00019=Sir, given the visual similarity between the various pieces, have you considered that they might combine to create a larger, more distinct object? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00020=With everything else going on, Stetmann, I couldn't care less what they do, just that we get paid when we finally hand 'em over to the Moebius boys. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00021=So these artifacts are the key to freeing Kerrigan...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00022=Pretty amazing coincidence, Tychus just showing up out of the blue... offering us the job to collect these damn things.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00023=Statistically, sir -- the probability of coincidence is miniscule. However, these artifacts do represent a power beyond our current scientific understanding... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00024=If anything could the give the Queen of Blades pause - perhaps these are it?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00025=Guess we'll find out soon enough. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00026=I've done some preliminary studies. Your artifact is a few thousand years old, but that makes it pretty 'young' in Xeno-archaelogical terms. Most alien artifacts are millions of years old. By comparison, this one was made recently.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00027=It ain't like anything protoss I've ever seen. But if they didn't make it... who did?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00028=All this... ancient alien hocus-pocus is a little outta my pay scale. I just pray that when the time comes...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00029=...these things bring her back to me.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00030=I've been hearing strange stories from the crew of late - unexplained noises, strange visions - voices in the dark. Rumor has it these things are haunted.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00031=Superstitious nonsense! These artifacts are completely inert and they're contained down here in the lab. There is some trace radiation, but I don't see how they could affect things elsewhere on the ship!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00032=[Surprise]Heaven forbid we run across alien tech that messes with our primitive little monkey brains.[/Surprise] Just keep a close eye on 'em, Doc.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00033=Holding these artifacts is making me nervous. Can you tell me any more about them?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00034=It's interesting - the one from Xil is different than the others. However, I think all of them once constituted a single device. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00035=You mean they make something bigger? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00036=It would seem so. It's just a theory, but there's an attraction between the artifacts we've collected - a kind of harmonic resonance. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00037=Given the points of contiguous translinear alignment I think they'd be drawn together like magnets under the right field adjustment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00038=Ohhhh kay. Well don't adjust anything just yet, Doc. I like them aligned just the way they are.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00039=So these things are still a big mystery, huh?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00040=Actually I have found something interesting. Whenever you use that protoss device over there, the artifacts respond by drawing together and expanding their molecular matrices.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00041=A little slower and with shorter words, please.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00042=Well, if you think of them as dry sponges, they draw ambient energy like water. These things try to absorb as much energy as they can.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00043=Are they dangerous?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00044=Not if you're human. If my theories are correct - and you were a protoss, for instance - they could drain the life right out of you.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00045=Valerian reckons this thing can...de-zergify Kerrigan once it's rebuilt. Do you think that's even possible?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00046=From what I've managed to piece together, it might be. The artifact seems to absorb protoss energy. If the same holds true for zerg...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00047=(Snaps) Just yes or no, Ariel. I need an answer!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00048=(snaps back) If I said 'no' would you even believe me? The only person that can really know what the artifact does is the one who made it - and they're long gone...I hope.

Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00012=Well, I'm just glad my research has helped the war effort, Commander.

Conversation/LabHanson/Line00001=Jim, let me in. What really happened on Tarsonis? Whatever it was, I can see it tearing you up inside. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00002=Well it would definitely affect brain chemistry, so it could be used as some kind of a drug or stimulant I suppose.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00003=I've run a few tests on the terrazine gas like you asked. It's clearly related to vespene gas, but there are some very exotic organics added into the mix. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00005=I understand. If you ever change your mind - I'm here.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00006=Drugs, huh? That's just wonderful.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00007=That's right, but I wouldn't mess with it if I were you. It's a Khaydarin 'Ihan' crystal. It's a memory storage device - lets you experience what other people have seen or done. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00008=I see we have a new acquisition. Is it a protoss device?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00014='Lot of rumors goin' around. I'm guessin' you've heard plenty about me and Kerrigan by now...
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00015=Are the stories true? That Mengsk just... abandoned her to the zerg on Tarsonis? 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00016=That zerg woman seemed to know you. She really rattled you didn't she?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00017=Me and her... well, we go back a ways. She was a Ghost, once. Back then we were hooked up with Mengsk and fighting to get rid of the old Confederacy. (beat) We made a pretty good team.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00018=What happened to her?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00024=Her...plus a few billion innocent civilians. After that we knew exactly what kind of man we'd been dealing with. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00027=She was a casualty of war. No offense, Doc, but I really don't like to talk about it.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00031=(bitter) Tarsonis... that's where it all went down. Mengsk stole a psi-emitter from the Confederacy and planted it there. He knew that it'd attract the zerg and... 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00034=Just out of curiosity, I did some tests on the minerals from Redstone. I thought you should know - I found trace quantities of jorium, a rare crystal with very unique properties. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00035=I'm all ears, Doc. What kind of properties?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00036=Jorium resonates at the same frequency as certain brain waves. It's been theorized that it could be used to stimulate brain activity or even produce psionic abilities in human subjects.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00038=A sudden increase in psionic ability could induce a psychotic break, but Spectres aren't the monsters we were led to believe. Nova lied to us.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00039=What the hell does Tosh want that for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00040=Any guesses what it's used for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00041=They can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doin'.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00042=I don't care about much of anything anymore, but the one thing I hold onto is seeing Mengsk brought to justice before I die.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00044=(sighs) Our revolution began that day - the day Mengsk murdered a whole planet and called it justice.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00047=Jim, I've been investigating the claims that Nova made about Spectres turning into psychotic killers. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00049=I can't believe it. That recording proves it's all true; Mengsk, Tarsonis, all of it... What will you do now?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00050=Tell the people. Every man, woman and child in the Dominion needs to know what their beloved Emperor is capable of.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00051=The backlash will be awful. There'll be riots and uprisings everywhere... But that's just what you want, isn't it?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00052=It's a start. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00055=Jim, I hear that we're working for the Dominion now. Is that true?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00056=We've got a chance to take on Kerrigan and maybe, just maybe, set things right. The devil himself could offer me that deal and I'd still take it. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00057=So what did you find out?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00058=[Sad 70]That's what worries me. [/Sad]Just don't lose sight of who you are - that's what's important. A lot of people are counting on you and... I'm one of 'em.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00061=[Surprise 70]Yet you don't fear it at all.[/Surprise] You're a fascinating man, Jim Raynor. You know more about the protoss and the zerg than any of the experts I've read about.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00071=My God. Billions of innocent people. That's...that's just...monstrous. No wonder you hate him so much.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00077=Honestly, there's no evidence that Spectres are any more prone to aberrant behavior than ordinary people. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00161=I'm ok, Doc, before you start asking. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00162=You were staring at that protoss device for a very long time.[Sad 70] Are you sure?[/Sad]
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00163=(spooked) Well, now you mention it I could use a drink or two. Maybe what I saw'd make more sense if I was drunk.

Conversation/Labconsole/Line00058=We're really close to understanding zerg biology on a whole new level! I know it'll be tricky, but some samples from zerg queens would give me the last few genetic components I need.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00060=The protoss have some incredible technology! I can unlock some of their secrets if we can find enough protoss relics for me to study.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00062=The protoss excel at energy manipulation. As I understand it, Arcthium gems are key to their technology. If we secure some of those I'm sure we can make a breakthrough.

Conversation/Labresearch/Line00002=I've detailed a new research project on the console, over there. Please take a look if you have time. It's right over there.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00003=Whoa. Those hunter-killer hydralisks were just fascinating! I've developed a new pathogen that can be delivered via high velocity gauss rounds. This will make our marines' ammunition particularly effective against biological targets!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00004=Well I have completed the research on exo-dermal plating, thank you very much. I've suggested some adjustments to Swann that'll make our flame weapons much more effective against zerg flesh!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00005=Well, it's all very complicated, the important thing is, it's protoss thinking combined with my own! Good stuff!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00006=I took alot of that protoss technology and added my own improvements. They're good. I'm good. It's good!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00007=Well well well, ladies and gentlemen I've cracked it! The queens' dissection provided some real insight into the zerg's biology. On a practical level, I've advised Swann about fine tuning of our siege tank ammunition to cause maximum damage!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00008=You know all that protoss stuff you found? Yeah, I based some of my work on that. Have a look!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00009=Ah those protoss relics are amazing. I've figured out a way to generate resonant kinetic fields that'll reinforce our vehicles' armor. Huh? Yeah!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00010=So, the zerg. They've got some pretty crazy biological elements! I used that to come up with something -- I think you'll like it.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00011=Ha! I was right about those Arcthium gems! Even using tiny slivers of them to boost our reactors' output increases energy regeneration by twenty five percent!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00012=Yeah, I used some zerg biology to come up with some amazing stuff! Watch out, I'm just getting started!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00013=Huh. Ahh, well the Dark Templar have developed some highly unusual tactics. We can't mimic their kind of fluid combat style exactly but the improved coordination we've learned will net us an increase in firepower for all of our units.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00014=Zerg! Stetmann! Together, it equals great research. Look on the console!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00015=That's an excellect choice, sir!

Once the Odin has taken out their defenses, we'll broadcast our evidence against Mengsk. Figure they'll throw everything they have at us. They'll be talking about this one for years.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00010=We've received classified intel about a top secret Dominion lab on Castanar. A small team should be able infiltrate the lab and uncover exactly what kind of research the Dominion is doing there.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00011=Moebius wants us to go after another artifact on some dead world called Xil. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00012=Seems yer Queen of Blades figured out who's been payin us to snatch up all them artifacts. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00013=We've secured our landing zone thanks to you, Commander. General Warfield believes an attack on the primary hive is suicide under current conditions. A diversionary attack to cripple part of the zerg defenses will give us the opportunity we need.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00014=New Folsom is ripe for the taking, man. Every voice that was ever raised against Mengsk is penned up inside those walls. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00015=Everything is in motion to begin the final act - the invasion of the primary zerg hive on Char!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00016=...The Dominion abandoned us here ...We're just a small farming colony.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00017=We've got to evacuate before we're overrun....If you can hear this message, please help us!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00018=But with so many people in close proximity, an epidemic of some kind has started sweeping through the camps. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00019=Dominion troops are seizing control of Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00020=They have stockpiled vast amounts of guns and resources at the Backwater Station.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00021=It seems my faith in your abilities has been vindicated, Commander Raynor. Now the final blow must be struck. Use the artifact to neutralize the Queen of Blades and bring this bloodshed to an end.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00022=Raynor... the hounds of the void are closing in... I impart my memory - my very essence - into this Ihan crystal... so that you will see what I have seen... and that the future... may yet have hope.  
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00023=The planet Redstone's got the most valuable minerals around - an' with the zerg invasion, the Kel-Morians packed up and left it all behind. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00024=Some enterprisin' men could turn a big profit there. Meet me at Redstone if you want a piece of the action.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00025=(laughs) We call it terrazine and it be worth a fortune to the right bidder. Of course those protoss'll kill us if they catch us on their holy ground - or at least they'll try.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00026=Seizing that stockpile would deal a serious blow the the Dominion effort on Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00027=I returned to our ruined homeworld of Aiur. The zerg infestation still covered much of our beloved world... The desiccated remains of the Overmind were still there - a grim reminder of battles lost... and battles won.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00028=We let all them prisoners loose an' he'll never know what hit him. Just let me know when you're ready to pull the trigger.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00029=Supposedly there's protoss guarding it - a group of fanatics, call themselves the Tal'darim.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00030=Now don't get all sentimental thinking these Tal'darim are your old protoss buddies... 'cause they ain't.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00031=Apparently they sent in a specialist team - but they lost contact with 'em two days ago. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00032=Their bad luck, I guess. Figure we'll get hazard pay for this one... 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00033=Moebius' head- honcho, Dr. Narud, claims the zerg are attacking his main Research Campus on Tyrador. He can't evacuate his people until all their artifact research is safe.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00034=Thanks to your actions Mar Sara is now in a state of open revolt against Arcturus Mengsk. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00035=If we intercept the trains and liberate their contents before they can be shipped off-world, we could make a serious profit. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00036=I gathered allies and we made our way to the forbidden archive world of Zhakul. There, a triumvirate of mystic Preservers awaited us. And in the shadows... something else was watching - and waiting.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00037=If our intel's right, he should still be based at the merc-haven at Deadman's Port. He's not very trustworthy, but he's our best bet of breaking that encryption. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00038=Now, friend Raynor, you must see the Overmind's vision of the future. The end of my people... and of all things. This is our fate, should Kerrigan die...
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00039=Moebius've got themselves set-up again since the zerg chased 'em outta their old place. They say they've worked out where to find another artifact, lovely little place called Typhon. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00040=Commander, our mutual friends at the Moebius Foundation have located the last artifact fragment. When this final piece is secured we can proceed to Char and confront Kerrigan. Good luck, Mr. Raynor, I fear you'll need it.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00041=My people established a new colony on Haven. It was going well, but now the colony's gone dark. They're not responding on any frequency. We need to get there and see what the situation is. They might have been exposed to the zerg virus, and they are on the verge of protoss space. Jim, I'm worried that something has gone very wrong.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00042=The dominion is unveiling a new war machine called the 'Odin' on Korhal. If we hijack the Odin we can use it to gain access to the UNN studios and broadcast the records of Mengsk's war crimes.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00043=The Odin is currently in the testing facility on Valhalla.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00044=Once we begin, there will be no turning back.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00045=I shall rendezvous with you as soon as I receive your signal. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00046=Ensure that you are fully prepared, Commander. Destiny awaits!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00047=Please - my people need help! We've got to do something before it's too late!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00048=Ex-convict Tychus Findlay has revealed the Dominion came to Mar Sara to excavate an alien artifact. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00049=Seizing the artifact will strike another blow against the Dominion and generate funds from selling it to Findlay's mysterious contacts.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00050=With the artifact secure you need to wait for transport at Backwater Station before you can leave Mar Sara. Transportation is on the way. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00051=Caution is advised - Dominion security forces may succeed in tracking the artifact to the station.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00052=The classified documents we found on Korhal imply the Dominion has a top secret bio-weapons lab on an orbital platform at Castanar. If the Dominion is cooking up a big surprise for us, I'd like to know about it.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00053=Backwater Station is the center of Dominion logistics on Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00054=Destroying Dominion authority here will cripple Emperor Mengsk's operations throughout the planet.
Conversation/OldRivals/Group00001=Old Rivals
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00001=The Zerg swarm came as was foretold.... and the Protoss, first born of the gods  -- rose to fight them. (beat) Now, the Xel'Naga that forged us all... are returning.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00002=But do they come to save...?
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00003=...or to destroy? 
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00004=(laughs) I knew you'd find your way here eventually.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00005=Your very presence defiles this place, Kerrigan.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00006=Do you hear them, Zeratul -- whispering from the stars? The galaxy will burn with their coming.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00007=Perhaps...
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00008=...but you won't live to see it!
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00009=Please. Our petty conflicts mean nothing now. A storm is coming that CANNOT be stopped. Fitting - that we should face oblivion together.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00010=Never! 
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00011=FATE cannot be changed. The END comes. And when it finds me... I shall embrace it at last.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00012=The prophecy is uncertain. There is always hope.

Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00006=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this. 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00007=It's done.  (beat)  Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit.  Now!

Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00003=Y'know, if you can get me a sample of that, I could probably do something with it. Scientifically, I mean.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00004=If you get some of that to me in the lab, I can learn alot about the protoss. Maybe something that would help us.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00005=I have no idea what that is! Can you bring me a sample in the lab? Maybe something good will come of it!

Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00003=He already left the ship. I thought you --
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00004=I won't accept that! Every one of my people can be saved. I'm close to finding the cure, I know it!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00005=Get Tosh on comms. I'm sure he's listenin' in anyway, encrypted or not.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00006=The choice is yours, James Raynor. We await your answer.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00007=Matt, open a channel to the protoss. Let's see how diplomatic they're feelin'.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00008=En Taro Tassadar, James Raynor. I am Executor Selendis. Your bravery and service to Aiur are known to us.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00009=En Taro Tassadar, Selendis. Listen - with all due respect, your fleet needs to pull back. The people on Haven are no threat to you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00010=Our Observers detected zerg hive spores infesting the colonists. They must be purified. If you wish to undertake this mission in our stead, we will permit it.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00011=Jim, some of my people are infested but you can't let the protoss just destroy them all! If you keep the protoss at bay, I know I can find a cure for the infestation.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00012=I ain't gonna stand by while you wipe out a whole colony, Selendis. Not while there's still a chance we can save 'em.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00013=Thank you Jim! Thank you so much. Whatever's happening on Haven, my people don't deserve to be wiped out. We'll make this right. I'll find a cure.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00014=I'm so sorry Ariel...but the Executor's right. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00015=Honor to you, James Raynor. You were ever a true friend of the protoss. Although this work is painful for you - many more lives will be saved by your actions this day.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00016=Sir, we have an incoming transmission. It's highly encrypted - (suspicious)and on a Dominion priority channel.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00017=Patch it through.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00018=Well, well - the infamous Jim Raynor. My name is Nova. We should talk.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00019=Now what would one of Mengsk's pet Ghosts have to say to me?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00020=Tosh is lying to you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00021=We Spectres be the future! You just couldn't handle it, little girl.  
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00022=It don't matter how much you hate Mengsk, Tosh. If you and your Spectres are as bloodthirsty as it sounds, you're as much of a threat as he ever was. I'll be seeing you real soon.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00023=You should have told me what you were really planning, Tosh. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00024=Uploading tactical data now.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00025=I knew I could count on you, brother. Now let's go and bust open New Folsom!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00026=Then it shall be an honor to meet you on the field of battle. Your reputation as a commander is most impressive. I trust you will live up to it.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00027=What?! This isn't right! I thought you were a better man than this, Jim!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00028=You've made a poor choice, Mr. Raynor. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00029=Help me bust open New Folsom and we'll bring down Mengsk together!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00030=Join me there and we can shut it down for good.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00031=They tried enhancing Ghost abilities using exotic materials like jorium and terrazine. The idea was to create something new... Spectres.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00032=But I'll take your word over a Dominion assassin's any day.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00033=Every Ghost that became a Spectre has gone on a psychotic killing spree. The ones I've captured are held in New Folsom.

Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00041=If you choose to resist us, we will meet in glorious combat.

Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00043=Sir, we have an incoming transmission. It's highly encrypted.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00044=Don't listen to her brother. Help me bust the Spectres from New Folsom, and we'll bring down Mengsk together!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00045=New Folsom is full of psychopathic killers. Do you really want to release them into the galaxy?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00046=I be helping you against Mengsk, and my people will too. She won't even join you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00047=He's a psychotic time bomb. He'll be on your side right up until he puts a knife in your back.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00048=You'll regret this, brother.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00049=We're almost to Haven, but there's still been no contact from -- 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00050=Jim! You have to stop this!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00051=Sir, there's a protoss fleet holding in orbit!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00052=They're disrupting all communications to the surface - and it looks like they're powering up their main weapons!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00053=Believe me, they wouldn't have come all the way here if their data wasn't conclusive.

Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00004=Well, placing charges at the right spots in their Nydus network could flood the whole system with lava. What's your take, General? 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00005=It's dangerous, but it could work. Bigger problem's still their fliers. Even if we could move our units forward, we can't provide adequate air cover while the skies are contested.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00006=Any suggestions?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00007=Intel shows eighty percent of the zerg fliers nest on an infested platform hanging in low orbit. We take that down, we'll own the air.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00008=Hell, if this platform's so important, why not just nuke it? 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00009=The nests are burrowed deep into the superstructure. Surface detonations won't do it. We'd need to land a strikeforce on the platform and take it apart piece by piece. It's your call, Raynor. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00010='Long as the zerg can use the Nydus network, our whole force is under threat. I feel for our fly boys - but shuttin' down those tunnels has to be our top priority.

Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00013=We can deal with the Nydus worms when they surface, but there ain't no way we can advance without air support. We gotta' take that platform down.

Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00003=Yeah, well, not yet, sir. I still need some additional specimens to get things going. [Happy 50]Once I get those, we can make some big improvements to our weapon systems and tactics![/Happy]
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00004=Well, I'm all for that. What do you need?
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00005=All kinds of things! I've entered the details into our database. If you run into something on a mission that we need, you'll be notified automatically.

Conversation/THanson01/Line00011=It's a long haul to the starport, partner. How can we be expected to guard the whole thing?

Conversation/THanson01/Line00036=Just a few stragglers left to bring in, their convoy's heading to the starport any minute now.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00037=Sir, we just detected zerg organisms entering the upper atmosphere. I can't give you an exact fix but they're heading your way.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00038=Sir, I'm picking up seismic disturbances closing in on your position. I think it's some kind of tunneling zerg.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00039=Wonderful, it's just like them to keep things nice and interestin'.

Conversation/THanson03B/Line00004=Ariel?
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00005=Sir, Stetmann says Dr. Hanson has locked herself in the lab. Alone. She's desperate to save her people, I'm worried about what she might do.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00006=I want some SCVs repairing those Vikings right now! I need 'em out there raising hell!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00007=The last settlement is under threat, sir.

Conversation/THanson03B/Line00009=The zerg have fully infested a settlement, sir, but we still need to destroy the structure there to stop it spreading further.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00010=Sir, the infested are closing in on a settlement to the north. 
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00011=The infestation's overwhelmed another settlement, there's no stopping this thing!

Conversation/THanson03B/Line00023=I knew Raynor'd save us!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00024=Eggs...those structures must be acting as giant incubators for the infested.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00025=There's no sign of the infestation left at that settlement, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00026=That settlement has been cleared of zerg bio-signatures. Well done, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00027=Good job, sir. I'm picking up two more concentrations of zerg bio-signatures.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00028=Sir, I'm detecting some large zerg flyers. They match the reported profiles for brood lords; be careful, they're lethal against ground targets.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00029=Then we'll hit 'em from the air! Where are my Vikings at?
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00030=They infest marines too, brother.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00031=Zerg infestation level reduced to thirty three percent. 
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00032=That's another one down, sir! No time to rest, though. There's still  more zerg clusters that need cleaning out .

Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00006=Don't worry about it. Swann's already got that covered.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00007=Yeah I got ya' covered. Had to call in a few favors to get the schematics for these babies. You owe me big time, Cowboy.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00008=Those Vikings'll make all the difference. But it looks like some of the infested colonists are turning already.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00009=Don't forget these bad boys can switch between air and ground mode any time you need 'em to.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00010=But there's only one way we can help them now. We've gotta save the ones we can - and kill the rest.

Conversation/THorner01/Line00013=Looks like the Dominion ran outta whatever they were juicing the trains with. They're putting out bigger escorts though, we better watch ourselves.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00014=Sir, the Dominion processing center is heavily guarded. We should just focus on taking out those trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00015=Damn, I ain't robbed a train in years! We should do this more often!
Conversation/THorner01/Line00016=Well I'll be. It's an old Confederate adjutant. Now what intel's so important they'd go and dig her up to recover it?
Conversation/THorner01/Line00017=A train is approaching through a tunnel in the northwest. 
Conversation/THorner01/Line00018=A train is exiting the southern tunnel.

Conversation/THorner01/Line00021=We obviously won't find many natural mineral fields here, so we should make the most of what we can salvage from the trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00022=The Dominion are constructing a series of bunkers to protect the tracks. Be careful.

Conversation/THorner02/Line00006=Thank you sir.

Conversation/THorner02/Line00020=I oughta do the universe a favor and put you down, Orlan. It's too bad I might need to hire you some day.

Conversation/THorner02/Line00023=Damn Jimmy, are those Vulture bikes?

Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00003=James. Orlan decrypted your adjutant but he's planning to sell it to the Dominion. Must have been something exciting in there!
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00004=That's nice, Mira, but why are you telling me all this?
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00005=Because I like you and Matthew better than him, of course! Match Orlan's offer and I'll help you take him out instead. He's paying in minerals, so I'll give you the same deal.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00006=(smiles and nods) Done. Always a pleasure, Mira.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00007=It's going to be hard to get minerals down there. We'll have to find salvage if we're going to hire Mira before Orlan does.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00008=Think she'll help Orlan sir?

Conversation/THorner03/Line00011=Hot Damn! I can't wait to get inside that thing and tear this place up!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00012=Excellent! With the Odin secured we can hit the UNN complex on Korhal and make our broadcast. 
Conversation/THorner03/Line00013=Does he always talk this much, Sir?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00014=Yep, once you get him in a fight he never shuts up.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00015=Scramble more Wraiths from the starport. If we have enough we can handle the battlecruisers.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00016=Hey can ya hear me 'Captain'? Maybe next time you'll trust ol' Tychus with a little bit o' mayhem.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00017=Hold your position Tychus! Let us get a support force up there to cover you!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00018=Now that's what I'm talking about!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00019=C'mon, Jimmy! We got heads to break!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00020=Here we go. I'm hittin' my stride now!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00021=This is going to get tricky...I'm detecting battlecruisers at the next base and the Odin doesn't have strong anti-air capabilities.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00022=BOOM, baby!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00023=This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00024=You want some of this?!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00025=Time to kick ass and chew bubble gum!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00026=What is that thing? Swann would love this place.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00029=Activate the auto-turrets!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00030=This ain't a stealth mission any more ladies. Bring it loud and fast!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00031=You ain't keepin' me from that monster!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00032=(Laughs)
Conversation/THorner03/Line00033=I see your little guys running around down there, Jimmy. Heh, they look like ants.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00034=Good old Tychus be right here takin' it easy...(yawns)
Conversation/THorner03/Line00035=Just wake me up when you're ready - I reckon a small nuke oughta do it, hehehe.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00036=Sir, I'm picking up Dominion battlecruisers on an intercept course with the Odin.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00037=So what's the plan now, Commander? Trash them bases right?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00038=Oh you want some of this? Boom!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00039=We should have enough Wraiths to handle them, but let's scramble a couple more just to be sure.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00040=Dammit, Tychus! Stand down! Can you read me?!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00041=(sighs contentedly) Now that hit the spot. There's nothing like knocking back a cold one on top o' yer enemies' smoking corpses!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00042=He's got it stuck on transmit, sir. He can't hear us at all. Defenses are coming online at the Dominion bases.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00043=Wonderful. Get our base set up ASAP. We'll just have to follow him in and hope he doesn't get too crazy. (beat) Ah, who am I kidding...
Conversation/THorner03/Line00044=Y'know, I think I'll take me another breather. You better get some back up ready for me, Jimmy.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00045=Ok, flashy red button what do you do?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00046=DAMN! Now that is HOT!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00047=Now that was fun! Don't worry, old buddy, I'll give you some time to catch up.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00048=Three bases down, maybe the convict has his uses after all.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00049=You reckon these Dominion boys'll put up a fight this time? I ain't barely broke a sweat.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00050=Hey now, that ain't fair!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00051=The Odin is in range, fire the Yamato cannon!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00052=Hello there, now how'd I miss this button with a skull on it?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00053=Nuclear launch detected.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00054=Oh baby! You're in for a world of pain!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00055=Hey hotshot, you want these Wraith fighters now? They'll take down a battlecruiser easy. You can build more at a starport.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00056=Well I'll be, those Dominion egg heads really thoughta everything. Pardon me a moment.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00057=There we go. Heh. You ready yet?

Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00003=Ready to rock!
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00004=Hopefully we can block all transmissions long enough for him to do that.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00005=He does get a little excited in combat, we're gonna need to keep up with him once the fightin' starts.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00012=Are you absolutely sure about this, sir?
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00013=Yep. Tychus is definitely our best man for this kind of job.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00014=If he can actually commandeer the Odin, it's vital that we take out all the Dominion bases in the area. 
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00015=How much do we know about this 'Odin'?
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00016=It's an experimental super-heavy siege walker designed for prolonged front line combat. Very powerful.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00017=Great, even Tychus can't wreck it then.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00018=Here they go-

Conversation/THorner04/Line00005=The Dominion's switched to a secure channel. I can't track their positions anymore. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00006=But I have gained access to the UNN network. We'll need troops to stay close to one of the broadcast towers long enough to get our message out. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00007=You can bet Mengsk'll have something to say about that. Let's get moving.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00008= All transmissions have been sent, Sir. Every world in the Dominion just got a 'UNN special bulletin' about Mengsk.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00009= Let's get out of here. We can enjoy the results from a nice, safe distance.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00010=I'm in the Dominion security network. Bringing up their locations now.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00011=Alright,Tychus - do your thing.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00012=Thought you'd never ask. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00013=An alert's gone out! It won't be long before they shut me out of their system.

Conversation/THorner04/Line00025=Behold the Dominion's newest weapon of war - the Odin!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00026=Implacable. Relentless. Invincible. The Odin is a stirring symbol of the unyielding strength of the Terran Dominion!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00027=We're almost done transmitting Mengsk's dirty little secret to the Dominion.

Conversation/THorner04/Line00033=Some might baulk at the cost of such a magnificent machine, but I say to you - what price do you put on your loved ones' security? 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00034=Kill team Renegade, take down the Odin! I'm counting on you boys!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00035=Yee haw!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00036=Kill Team Death Dealers, retire that Odin for me!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00037=The Odin is still standing? Take it down! Now!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00038=There's only one man arrogant enough to think he can get away with this - Raynor!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00039=Hah. Just for once Arcturus, this really is all about you. I hope you enjoy our show.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00040=I knew it. Warfield! Get your men down there. I want Raynor's head, you understand!? Him and all his terrorist friends!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00041=Man, I am so sick of seeing Mengsk's face! Tychus, do me a favor and blast any of those damned statues you see. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00042=Security breach at one of the towers. Strike team Alpha, engage! Stop them!

Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00001=Our raid on the Valhalla facility hasn't even been reported yet. The Dominion have no idea we stole the Odin. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00002=So they're still expecting to film it at the UNN studios later today?
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00003=That's right -- and we won't disappoint them. Seeing as he's the only one with experience, Tychus will pilot the Odin and hit the studio guards with a surprise attack. They'll be confused for several minutes - and won't even know who to attack at first. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00004=And during the confusion, we'll establish a forward base using this command center we 'acquired' earlier. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00005=Keep in mind -- we'll only have a few minutes before the Dominion realize that Tychus is in the Odin. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00006=Once they figure it out they'll use everything they've got to stop us.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00007=Whatever happens, we'll be givin' Mengsk one hell of a broadcast. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00008=Pretty devious, Matt. I like it. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00009=Let's do this. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00010=I had to call in every favor I had, but I got the Odin on the surface, with Tychus inside.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00011=If Tychus can inflict enough damage during the sneak attack, making the broadcast should be relatively easy. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00012=Matt, you're a miracle worker. It must have been a complicated operation.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00013=You don't even want to know sir. I'm not going to let anything keep us from exposing Mengsk.

Conversation/THorner05S/Line00008=Hold on...the signal's weak in there. Wait. Sir -- I'm reading both zerg and protoss DNA. Were those... things assimilated somehow? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00009=I don't know. But I'm real curious as to what they're doing inside a Dominion lab. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00010=They were testing these weapons...on the specimens. What the hell have they been up to here? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00011=Looks like the same creature was mutated and cloned over and over. Matt, you got any additional info? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00012=Stetmann's been running some tests, sir. He says the specimens' DNA strands have been artificially spliced. Whoever's in charge of this mess did it deliberately.

Conversation/THorner05S/Line00018=Just what I wanted to hear. Thanks for the head's up. Stay tight on me! Let's move, Raiders!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00019=Matt, can you read me? I'm inbound in some big transport the Dominion was nice enough to supply. Don't shoot us down!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00020=You got it, sir! But why would the Dominion even want to create something as monstrous as that Hybrid?
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00021=I don't know... but I have a real bad feeling it ain't the last we'll see of it.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00022=Hm. Fry any rebel you see!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00023=Surprise, surprise, the door's sealed. Nothing a little breaching charge won't cure.

Conversation/THorner05S/Line00026=Zerg! They're coming from the holding pen! Destroy it, boys, we gotta block 'em out! 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00027=They got out! That ain't good...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00028=Hold 'em back! Don't let 'em in the lab!

Conversation/THorner05S/Line00033=We got trouble ahead, that cargo bay's big enough for heavy units.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00034=What th -
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00035=Oh yeah. Siege tanks...Vikings...Wait...Some kinda warbot? Looks like I can pick a weapon upgrade and activate it from this console. Here goes...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00036=That bot won't last long, let's move!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00037=You reading me, Matt? I could use some reinforcements down here. They got something big in the next room and I don't think it's friendly.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00038=You got it, sir. I only have one dropship available. What do you need?
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00039=Brutalisk, huh? So the Dominion's doing research on these things too. Mean looking sucker...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00040=System accessed. Decrypting security overrides. System control established.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00041=Well... I'm picking up a strong power signature close to you. There must be a large fusion reactor somewhere in the facility.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00042=C'mon ladies, we need to keep movin'. Blast through that rubble!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00043=Ah hell, that debris won't hold it for long! Keep moving! Go! GO!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00044=The hybrid is on the move!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00045=Another Warbot! Adjutant, send it after the hybrid to buy us some time!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00046=Let's move!

Conversation/THorner05S/Line00051=Whoa! What the hell!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00052=This might not be the best time to take on a giant zerg monster, but Stetmann still needs more Brutalisk samples to complete his research. It's your call.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00053=Yes, sir. Your reinforcements are inbound.

Conversation/TTosh01/Line00002=Reapers you say? Hell, cowboy, we gotta train more of these guys, they're seriously bad ass!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00003=Your men work fast. We've already got half the minerals we need.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00004=Almost done, Mr. Raynor. Just a few more minerals to go.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00005=Ah, sir! Sir! Ah scanners show a large bio-signature close to your position - a Brutalisk I think! If you could kill it that'd get my...err our research off to a flying start!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00008=This counter shows the estimated time until the next lava surge. Move all units and structures to high ground when a surge is imminent.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00009=Alert. Zerg approaching. Defenses required. Expended minerals will diminish the mining quota, so caution is advised.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00010=Seismic activity is increasing. Caution is advised.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00012=I got some friends comin' to help you out - Reapers. 
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00013=Alert. Lava surge imminent. Evacuate low ground immediately.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00016=Just a reminder sir; the more minerals we expend on forces, the longer it's going to take to reach our goal. Try to be economical.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00017=Damn, losing all those SCVs is gonna set us back. I'm gonna call in some reinforcements.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00018=Sir, command centers aren't cheap. We don't have any more replacements so try and be more careful with this one .
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00037=All clear. It is now safe to proceed with mining operations.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00040=Some of my boys disappeared in this area. Wanna see if they're still alive.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00041=Tosh sent ya to help? About time! Let's finish up this contract and get the hell off this planet.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00046=Since you're doin' right by me - I'll do right by you. Here's the coordinates of the nearest mineral nodes.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00047=I scanned for mineral outcrops before we landed. Sending more data to you now.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00048=Doin' well there, Mr. Raynor. We got traces of more minerals over on the other side of the canyon.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00066=Alright boys, nice work. We got what we came for. Now lets get outta this hellhole!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00067=Finished already? You really are as good as they say Mr. Raynor. I'm thinking you and I got a lot more business we can be talking about.

Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00003=What's the catch?
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00004=I ever mention how much I hate volcanic planets?
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00005=Of course that's where the richest mineral nodes are found. But that'll be no problem for a big tough guy like you.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00006=We'll need to spend some of what we mine just to defend the operation. The more we spend, the longer this is gonna take.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00007= and I'll make it worth your while.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00008=(resigned) Let's do this.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00010=Well, this place is a little...unstable. The low ground gets flooded with lava every few minutes.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00011=Sir, I'm also picking up zerg bio-signatures on the surface.

Conversation/TTosh02/Line00002=Here are the coordinates for the terrazine sites, brother. This should make our lives a little easier.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00003=Bold move, Mr. Raynor, collecting terrazine from two places at once!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00004=Sure, it's gonna be harder to keep the Tal'darim off our backs, but the quicker we're done here the sooner we can get off this rock.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00005=The protoss are mobilizing, sir. Looks like they're gonna go after our SCVs when we harvest the terrazine. I suggest we only harvest one site at a time and run with a heavy escort.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00006=I've got the first canister unhooked, sir! I'll take it to the nearest command center...
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00007=These reckless terrans must be stopped! Slay them all!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00008=Fries your...? What the hell are you talking about?
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00009=Nothing to worry about...Nothing at all.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00010=This land was sacred to the Tal'darim before terrans ever reached the stars! You must depart immediately!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00011=Hold on now. We just need some of this gas here, and we'll be long gone before you know it.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00012=No! You shall not defile the Breath of Creation! Tal'darim warriors, execute all those who would desecrate our altars!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00013=Good job! That's the first canister filled.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00014=Sir, our SCVs are getting hammered out there! We need a stronger escort or static defences to protect them.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00015=You shall not steal the Breath of Creation so easily!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00016=Three down. You're doing great! Keep it up!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00017=That's over half the canisters you wanted.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00018=You and your Raiders sure can walk the walk! We just need one more canister.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00019=This ain't good. If the Tal'darim seal off any more terrazine, there won't be enough left for us!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00020=Damn those Tal'darim! Every altar they shut down sets us back further. You need to get some of your boys out there and stop them!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00021=We gotta slow the Tal'darim down some! They've sealed off five geysers already!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00022=Wonderful. The Tal'darim are sealing off the terrazine altars so we can't get at 'em! If they keep it up we won't be able to collect enough.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00023=Careful! They're sending their ships to take out your SCV's! Shoot 'em down quick or we're finished!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00024=Warning. The Tal'darim are sealing off a terrazine altar.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00066=That's the last canister! I think we've outstayed our welcome, boys!

Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00004=I don't much like fightin' protoss if I can avoid it.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00005=Swann, get the Goliath schematics loaded at the factory. If their anti-air missiles are still any good, we might just pull this off.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00006=See those altars? Tal'darim mystics set them up to collect the terrazine. We just need to grab it.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00007=Well, our SCVs'll be able to haul the terrazine. We just got to keep 'em protected.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00008=With any luck we can pick up what we need before the Tal'darim find us.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00009=How do we get to the terrazine?
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00010=Alright, cowboy. I'll get the Goliath schematics loaded so we can build more.

Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00004=See if you can slow down the Dominion so we can build up some defenses.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00005=Tosh, you're nearing the first military cell block now. Releasing the prisoners might buy us some allies.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00006=We're rollin' now! Keep 'em busy while we establish our forward position! 
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00007=Nice work, Tosh, freeing those prisoners will really help us out. 
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00008=Now those boys are free we can bust this place wide open, great job, Tosh!

Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00015=We've got trouble back here, Tosh. Sure could use your help cleaning it up.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00016=The Dominion are pushing us back. We're gonna lose the forward base at this rate!

Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00021=With my cloaking abilities, I can take out all these guards. They'll never see me.

Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00024=When I need energy I can use Consumption to get more. I just steal a little life from an ally.

Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00003=Even an army couldn't get you in there. But one man - one Spectre in the right place - can find a way in.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00004=Then our progress is all up to you, Tosh. I'll push my boys as hard as I can, but they're gonna need your help to gain ground.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00005=Sure. You sit back this time. I'll take the lead and clear the way. Just keep sending troops to keep the pressure on, an' I'll do the rest. 
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00006=There's a Dominion base right by the main prison entrance. Take that out and the guards will retreat.

Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00032=I'm sending in more Reapers. They're on their way now.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00033=The gate's open! Let's make some noise!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00034=I have a present for you, Mr Raynor. Best start runnin'!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00035=Tosh isn't paying us enough to fight a ghost.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00036=Air-cav has arrived! Give us a target!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00037=I'm gettin' tired of this. Why don't you just DIE!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00038=You're right, Raynor. A well-placed nuke would wreak some serious havoc on those defenses.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00039=Let's just bug out and call it even.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00040=That's it!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00041=Should just... take... a f... there!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00042=Dominated units will remain under Nova's control until she releases them.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00043=While units are Dominated, Nova is free to move and attack as normal.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00044=Dominated units will remain under Nova's control until the timer runs out.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00045=An Ultralisk? Tosh sure keeps some exotic pets.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00046=Nuclear missile ready.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00047=I ain't your brother. You're a murdering psychopath.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00048=You working for Mengsk now, brother. How does it feel?
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00049=Nova will just stab you in the back, Raynor. It's what she does.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00050=Sendin' your men into my station. You just gonna get 'em all killed.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00051=Better men than you have tried to kill me Raynor. An' I'm still standin'.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00052=I've got detection everywhere, brother. You can't run, you can't hide.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Comment00001=Raynor and Horner are standing in front of the holoscreen as it pans across Avernus station, Nova's portrait is to one side of the main picture.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Comment00002=Camera zooms into the screen for the gameplay footage.  Footage shows surveillance of various parts of the platforms, possibly with Nova looking down from cliffs.  Would be awesome if we could show a 3-way split screen with all 3 targets on screen. If we go sequentially the first two targets should be moved into the bottom left and right POIs after they have been identified.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Comment00003=Screen shows Jorium stockpile
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Comment00004=Screen shows the Terrazine tanks, an image of the Jorium stockpile appears in the bottom left POI

Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Group00001=Intro cinematic
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00001=So this is where Tosh plans on building his Spectre army.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00002=I've identified three facilities that are vital to his operation. 
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00003=Our first target will be the Jorium stockpile...
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00004=Next will be the Terrazine tanks...
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00005=And finally the psionic waveform indoctrinator Tosh uses to complete the Spectres' activation process.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00006=Alright, so we destroy all three of those targets and Tosh is out of business.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00007=Tosh knows every trick in the book when it comes to infiltration. I can penetrate most of his defenses, but I'll need your backup to get through them all.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00008=And what about Tosh?
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00009=Just leave him to me.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00010=Let's get this party started.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00012=I've cleared a landing zone for your forces.

Conversation/TTychus01/Line00003=I got something new for ya, Cowboy! Marauders - the latest word in big badda boom hardware.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00004=What are you still fighting for, Jim? [Happy]Are you intending to keep the promise you made and put me out of my misery?[/Happy] (laughs)
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00005=I ain't sure this is the best time to be experimenting, Swann.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00006=Pfft. 'Best time there is! Let the Marauders loose against those Stalkers and you'll see. 
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00007=(Laughs) Don't take too long now - time's running out... for all of us.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00008=You know I'm a man of my word, darlin'. 
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00009=Hey, you ain't gonna leave your base completely undefended are you, Jimmy?
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00010=Warning. Incoming zerg attack wave detected.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00011=I got a crew coming down to pick up the artifact!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00012=What the - !?
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00013=I'm picking up emanations from protoss relics close by. Stetmann has requested we collect as many as possible to assist in his research.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00016=Warning. Protoss Stalkers are gathering at our perimeter.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00040=This is crazy, man! We can't take the zerg in a stand-up fight, and you know it!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00041=(snarls) Leave the tactics to me, Tychus.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00045=The zerg severely outnumber the protoss forces. It is likely the protoss will fall shortly.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00046=Well here's the plan.Then we've gotta get that artifact before the zerg overrun the whole place!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00050=Warning - the zerg have almost reached the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00052=Warning! The zerg have begun extracting the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00067=We got what we came for! Let's high-tail it out of here!
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Comment00001=Camera continues to track the zerg as they rush towards the shrine - engaging protoss along the way.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Comment00002=Camera cuts back to Raynor and Tychus.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Comment00003=Close on Raynor. 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Comment00007=Camera cuts back to the map as we scroll across... 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Comment00008=Camera fades in to show the holo-screen - Raynor and Tychus watch a view of the shrine and the artifact location on the main screen. A view of the planet is in the bottom left POI, the top of the shrine itself is shown in the bottom right POI

Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00002=Them critters were just hiding underground, waitin'?
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00003=No idea. But you can bet they're headed straight for our shrine!
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00006=Well, that sure complicates things. We can't fight two armies at once, partner...
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00007=With any luck we won't have to. 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00008=We only need to hold the area at the top of the shrine long enough to extract the artifact. 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00009=It's only a matter of time before the zerg overwhelm the protoss. We'd best grab the artifact and be long gone by then.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00010=So we'll land here and cut our way through the protoss lines while they're busy with the zerg.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00011=There it is, Jimmy, just like Moebius said. Easy money.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00012=I don't know. There's a lot of protoss down there. We're gonna have to - what the?

Conversation/TTychus02/Line00003=Hold up there! Those protoss cannons will tear us a new one if we try to advance. Swann? You promised me siege tanks! Where are they?
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00004=Settle down, hotshot. They're comin'. These babies'll knock those cannons down from a nice, safe distance.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00005=These new siege tanks work just like the old ones. When you put 'em in siege mode they get increased range and firepower.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00006=They can't move in siege mode, so if you need to reposition 'em, just switch 'em back into tank mode. Y'got it?
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00007=What do we care, long as the pay's good.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00008=Fire it up! One hundred and seventy four gigawatts - 'the power of the sun at your fingertips.' Now get it aimed at that door and let's get cuttin'!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00009=We need bunkers and siege tanks defending that laser drill! We've got no chance of claiming the artifact without it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00010=Hey hey hey! We need that damn drill! Don't trash it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00011=Get an SCV to repair that laser drill! We're gonna need it to get to the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00012=Those are our guys! Careful with that thing!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00013=The laser drill has breached the door's outer layer.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00014=Let's get some siege tanks deployed on the high ground! They can pound that protoss Stalker before it even gets close to us.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00015=Really? I'd say gettin' vaporized by the Tal'darim definitely counts as 'diminishing returns.'
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00016=Alright. You heard the man! Swing that laser around! We can use it to drive back the protoss!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00017=What's wrong? Just use the laser to blast these protoss freaks!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00018=We need guards by the laser drill! The protoss are hitting it hard!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00019=Those freaks are smashing up the laser! Do something!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00020=Protect the laser drill! We can't let them destroy it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00021=We need some guns around the drill! Lose it and we're screwed!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00022=The laser drill is now cutting through the door's thermal barrier.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00023=You would desecrate that which belongs to the gods? This will NOT be borne by the faithful!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00024=Thermal barrier breached. The laser drill is now cutting through the core.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00025=Still you persist! It is heresy to touch the artifacts of the Benefactor!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00026=Breach of the doorway core is imminent. Structure access imminent.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00027=They seek to befoul the legacy of the gods! Destroy them!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00028=It is our sacred duty to stop these defilers! Burn them to ashes!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00029=Alert. Enemy air units on approach vector.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00030=Damn it. Air units nothin' - those're transports! Use the laser and knock 'em down fast!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00031=Sir! More air units inbound!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00032=We gotta take them out or they'll keep dropping troops right on top of us!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00033=There's another wave of air units heading your way!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00034=These guys just won't give it up... Stick it to 'em boys!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00035=Sir, I'm picking up the energy signatures of several protoss relics in the area. I'm marking them on your map.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00036=Well if there's time we can blast 'em free with the laser drill  - I bet Stetmann'd love to study them.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00037=Sir, the Tal'darim are mobilizing their forces against us.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00038=Sir, I've managed to access what's left of the Moebius expedition's sensor net. I'll route it through your map so you can see what the Tal'darim are up to.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00039=Laser output is good. Drilling will take some time but there's no other way into the temple. 
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00040=Moebius base local-net accessed. Decrypting security overrides. Transferring control of base structures to you, Commander.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00041=So we set a perimeter and protect the drill until we're through. I'm just glad we've got siege tanks...
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00042=Sir, those are protoss archons. If they get too close our men won't stand a chance!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00043=I'm giving you manual control of the laser drill - see if you can use it against the protoss!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00044=The Tal'darim just can't stand up to our firepower, they're in full retreat! Well done, sir!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00045=Commander. A large Tal'darim force is moving in to attack.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00046=Sir, looks like these protoss are a radical group of fanatics calling themselves the Tal'darim.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00048=Watch your corners, boys. We don't know who cleaned this place out.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00066=You have prevailed for now. Word of this sacrilege will echo across the stars, James Raynor. The day of reckoning draws near!

Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00004=I hate to think about what could have wiped 'em out.  
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00007=So here's the deal. This place is a morgue. Whatever used to live in these ruins up an' died millions of years ago.
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00009=Before they went missin', the Moebius team reported artifact radiation emanating from that big ol' hunk o' rock over yonder. They brought a big damn laser drill to burn their way in. 
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00011=Laser drill? That thing's a monster. If the Moebius team had access to that kinda hardware...

Conversation/TTychus03/Line00008=I can sense you're trying to keep something from me.

Conversation/TTychus03/Line00011=That's one down! Keep it moving, boys!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00012=Watch it! Lurker! Those bastards attack while they're burrowed - we need some detection out there to root it out.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00013=We better get to that data core fast, Jimmy. The queen-bitch over there is gettin' awful close.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00014=Sir, Kerrigan is close to finding a data-core. Its vital that you destroy the core before she gets to it.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00015=Raynor's Raiders? Get us out of here!

Conversation/TTychus03/Line00024=Hey Raynor! We saw some movement over at Rob's Guns. There might be some survivors in there.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00025=Of course! The Moebius data cores! You won't get the rest of them!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00026=Ah hell. At least she doesn't know where to find the other cores. We better get to the next one, fast!

Conversation/TTychus03/Line00028=Nice of you to drop by. I was runnin' low on ammo.

Conversation/TTychus03/Line00032=Time is running out, sir! You have to move now if you're going to beat Kerrigan to that data core.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00033=Sir, you better do something about that Nydus worm before our base gets overrun!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00034=She fears their power - just as she fears the Xel'Naga who created them. The Xel'Naga created both the protoss and the zerg, Commander. They were the gods of their time. 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00035=Alright, Doctor - you wanna tell me why the Queen of Blades wants these artifacts so damn bad?
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00036=Brutalisk! Stetmann wanted one of those things to research. I reckon we can oblige him.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00037=For all her strength, the Queen of Blades is nothing but an impotent child in comparison.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00038=You never could recognize a lost cause, could you Jim?

Conversation/TTychus04/Comment00003=Migration: You will need to move your force and your base to get away from the wall of fire. Plan for this as early as possible.
Conversation/TTychus04/Comment00004=Salvage: Remember to salvage buildings that cannot be lifted off and moved. All minerals spent for the structure are refunded when you salvage them.
Conversation/TTychus04/Comment00005=New Unit: Banshee - Banshees are powerful air-to-ground units armed with precision firing missiles. They have the ability to cloak themselves to allow for devastating sneak attacks.
Conversation/TTychus04/Comment00006=New Ability: Cloak - Cloak allows Banshees to become invisible so they can make strikes on positions deep within enemy territory. Watch out for enemies with cloak detection like Photon Cannons and Observers!
Conversation/TTychus04/Comment00007=Wall of Fire: The planet is being bombarded by solar flares from the nearby sun that create a slow moving wall of fire. Air units, like the Banshee, take much less damage than ground units do from the fire wall.

Conversation/TTychus04/Line00002=Resources have been exposed by the fire wave. They can be collected by any ground unit.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00003=This Tal'darim base is in a good spot for us. We just need to clear them out and take possession.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00004=This makes no sense! Sir, the Tal'darim aren't retreating from the fire wall!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00005=Neither fire, nor the fury of war will drive us from this hallowed site! The artifact shall remain inviolate! 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00006=The Tal'darim base has been cleared, that should buy us a little elbow room.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00007=You need to destroy that next Tal'darim base, sir! We need the room to move our own base structures forward.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00008=Good work, sir. With that base cleared we'll be able to keep ahead of the fire-wave a little longer.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00009=James Raynor! We anticipated your arrival! Now you will pay for desecrating our holy relics!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00010=Oh hell, not these Tal'darim guys again. They seriously need to learn when to quit.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00011=Our warriors' sacrifice was not in vain! We gladly march towards death to ensure your doom!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00012=Keep yer skirt on, Sparky! Jimmy'll get to it when he's good an' ready.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00013=Alert. Fire-wave approaching. Base structures are at risk. Immediate relocation advised. 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00014=Don't forget to salvage any structures you can't take with you, sir!

Conversation/TTychus04/Line00016=The fire-wave's right on top of us, sir! We need to move our base structures or they'll be destroyed!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00017=Hope you brought your sun-screen, cowboy.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00018=Now ain't the time, Swann.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00019=Relax, hotshot. I got something useful for ya'; Banshees. These babies can blow the snot outta ground forces. Got cloaking too. Gotta love that!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00020=We will pursue you to the end of the universe, James Raynor! A thousand deaths cannot atone for your wanton sacrilege!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00021=Nice job, let's get our base up and running and get that artifact!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00022=Whoa! Careful of those protoss cannons! They can detect banshees even when they're cloaked!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00023=The Tal'darim outpost to the east would make an excellent location to move our base to - we just need to clear them out and take possession.

Conversation/TTychus04/Line00033=Sir, the planet's crust is melting in front of the fire wave. You'll be able to find extra resources at the wave's forward edge
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00034=Warning. Fire wave approaching.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00035=Resources are spread pretty thin here Sir. We've deployed a second command center to help with collection.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00036=Sir, that star is flaring up. It's going to get a lot hotter down there very soon.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00037=Solar flare imminent. Evacuate all forces to a safe location.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00038=Sir there's another solar flare headed your way. Better pull back to a safe location.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00039=Another solar flare incoming. Get to safety.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00040=I don't have good news sir. There's another flare in the works.

Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00008=Our mobile structures can relocate and keep us just ahead of the fire, but we'll need to salvage everything we can't take with us.
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00009=The good news is, we've got a significant cache of supplies planetside, so we shouldn't need to build supply depots.
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00010=Well, that's something. So where's our artifact?
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00011=Slow down, Matt. What's it mean?
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00012=It means the star will go nova in a few hours.

Conversation/TTychus05/Line00015=An' just hand the artifact over to those Tal'darim freaks? Hell no!

Conversation/TTychus05/Line00029=Alright, we're clear. Grab that thing and set a course to rendezvous with Valerian.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00030=You just  gonna give it up like that? 
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00031=Yeah, Tychus, just like that.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00032=That protoss mothership is formidable, sir. Scans indicate it's capable of cloaking nearby friends and phasing enemies out of existence for a short time.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00033=Take your time, Commander. I'd rather do this right and get the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00034=The vault! We are very close to the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00035=What do you think sir? Quick smash and grab?
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00036=We destroyed the generator, but the rip-field is still there!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00037=I think there's a second one. We've got to disable it fast.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00038=Damn, this old thing's spooky. Let's hit that vault and get out of here.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00039=And leave the artifact?

Conversation/TTychus05/Line00047=Damn you Raynor! You've freed the cursed Dark Templar!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00048=Commander, the mothership warped back to the vault.

Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00003=Pretty far off the beaten path, junior...
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00004=The artifact is ...here. The ship has several Rip-field generators which disintegrate everything at a molecular level in a matter of moments.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00006=Well, long range scans have identified a sizeable Tal'darim force holding in the area.

Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00009=While Mengsk has a lot of faith in General Warfield, I should point out that the general is an honorable man and was not associated with Mengsk when Tarsonis fell.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00010=There you have it, viewers. With Warfield in command, the zerg Swarm will be defeated in no time. Up next: Raynor ups his campaign of terror -- just as the zerg reappear. Coincidence? You decide after these messages.

Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00008=They have no faith in Emperor Mengsk's leadership.

Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00009=Donny, Emperor Mengsk today announced that he's ordered the fleet to turn away refugee ships that enter core-world systems. Which raises the question -- will Dominion ships really fire on unarmed civilian vessels? General Warfield had this to say:

Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00007=Ladies and gentlemen, each night I bring you the news in the most fair and balanced manner possible. But tonight I have a commentary.
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00008=Some have asked me what the difference is between our leader, Emperor Mengsk, and the traitor Jim Raynor. They point out that Mengsk rebelled against the government of his youth, and came to power through the use of violence and subversion. Why is it wrong for Jim Raynor to rebel in similar fashion?
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00009=There is a difference. When Emperor Mengsk began his revolution, there was no threat hanging over humanity. James Raynor is waging his revolution while we are at war with two alien races.

Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00007=I've heard these conspiracy theories before. But the fact remains the zerg invaded Tarsonis en masse and no force in the universe could have stopped their onslaught. It was a very...terrible day.  
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00008=Emperor, much has been written in regards to the tragic fall of Tarsonis. Tilosky's investigative documentary 'Imperial Dawn', even claims that you brought down the Confederate system by assuring Tarsonis' fall.
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00009=Tilosky's film highlights the seeming...convenience of the aliens annihilating a corrupt government that you yourself spent a lifetime trying to overthrow.

Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00002=While the nature of his abrupt mental breakdown remains unknown, we do know that he was clad only in his socks and rumored to be in possession of Emperor Mengsk's manifesto and a pound of peanut butter.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00003=We wish you all the best, Donny, and hope for your speedy recovery. In the meantime, I'll be taking over as chief anchor here at UNN. For UNN, I'm Kate Lockwell.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00004=I hope that pompous ass rots in his -- oh wait, is this thing on?

Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00002=Kate, there's no need to belabor that topic. Highness, I think the question on everyone's mind is: do you have a special lady in your life?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00003=I... ah, what?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00004=We have a very special guest today... crown prince Valerian! Thank you so much for joining us, Highness!
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00005=Thank you Kate, it's wonderful to be here.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00006=Let me get right to the question on everyone's mind -- is there anyone special in your life right now?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00007=Truth be told, Kate, I have had a crush on you for many years.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00008=Oh stop!
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00009=But in all seriousness, with the zerg invasion, there's little time for such things. I've been studying military tactics under General Warfield, and whatever spare time I have is devoted to statecraft.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00010=It's my goal to be the best emperor our people could ask for.  When the time comes, of course.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00011=Wonderful, now I've got two of 'em to worry about.

Conversation/TValerian01/Line00002=Yes, sir! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00003=I so love the way you kindle their hope, Jim. By all means - bring them all to my doorstep. It'll be like lambs to the slaughter. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00004=(to the men) Don't listen to her! Stay focused and we'll make it out of here together!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00005=(seething) That beautiful young ultralisk was one of my favorites. Now you've really pissed me off!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00006=We're on our way General! Just hold on...Damn, he can't even hear us.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00007=(ghostly laughter)
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00008=We've reached the crash-site! With any luck, old Warfield's still alive and kickin'! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00009=Warfield won't be alive for very much longer. My pets will be drawn to his fear and that of his men. There's absolutely nothing you can do.  
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00010=Matt, keep me updated on those drop pods as they get to Char.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00011=If we can reach enough of them before the zerg, we might just have a chance of fighting our way through this.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00012=You're sure talkin' a lot, Kerrigan. Maybe the fear you smell is your own. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00013=(laughing) Some invasion. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00014=Yeah, well bring 'em all on, darlin'! There's more where that came from!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00015=Sir, I'm tracking an incoming drop pod. It should be landing close to your position any second.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00016=You dare to challenge me in my own lair? Hah!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00017=I'm sure it's hard for you to keep count of the losses, Jim - I'll help!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00018=That's one.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00019=Two.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00020=... is Gen... Warfield. To any Dominion ship in... range, my ship is down ...nd we've sustained heavy losses.

Conversation/TValerian01/Line00022=Raynor's Raiders! We sure are glad to see you boys! But where's General Warfield?

Conversation/TValerian01/Line00024=Four.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00025=Five.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00026=Alright, let's get out there and find 'em before the zerg do!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00027=Sir, I've detected a drop pod in your vicinity.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00028=You were fools to come here!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00029=The ashes of Char are already thick with the blood of my enemies. You'll soon join them!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00030=You seriously thought you could come into my house and slaughter my children? This world will be your grave!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00031=Sending coordinates to a nearby drop pod.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00032=Sir, another drop pod is coming down near your location.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00033=They all die so fast... it's hard to keep count.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00034=How many men have you led to their deaths here, Jim?
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00035=Hurry up and die!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00036=You've got another drop pod landing near by.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00037=Sir, another drop pod has arrived near your perimeter.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00038=We can salvage some of the wreckage from the Dominion base for resources. If we find more, we can put it to good use. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00039=At least a barracks made it down in one piece! Fly it somewhere safe behind our lines and start producing!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00040=Commander. Tactical analysis indicates the zerg greatly outmatch your current forces.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00041=Then we'll keep rallying survivors until we can pull this off!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00042=Get this factory back to the landing zone and get it building! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00043=Some air power is just what we need! Secure this starport and bring it behind our guns.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00044=Sir, I read multiple drop pods entering the atmosphere. I don't think you'll have enough time to rescue them all, not with this much zerg in the area.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00045=Dammit! We'll rescue as many as we can. But I don't think everyone's gonna live through this.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00046=There's another wave of drop pods coming in, sir. It would be too dangerous to try and rescue them all.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00047=Commander, the last of the Dominion drop pods have reached the surface of Char.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00048=Me too, Matt, guess there's only one way to find out.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00049=We should mobilize everything we've got and try to break through to Warfield.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00050=Looks like we're on our own, boys.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00051=Our supplies and troops are being shot down by the planetary defenses. Anyone on the surface, try to take down those defenses!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00052=That's one down. How many of these planetary defenses are there?
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00053=I guess we'll find out.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00054=Whoever is taking out those defenses down there, you have my gratitude.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00055=That should about do it!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00056=Mayday! Mayday! This is General Warfield. My ship is taking terrible... terrible damage!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00057=The only way we're gettin'  to Warfield is straight through those Nydus worms.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00058=The zerg planetary defenses are made up of Spore Cannons. They destroy targets entering the planet's orbit.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00059=My beautiful ultralisk. You will regret that. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00060=Commander, Valerian is sending cargo pods to the surface.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00001=(on Char set) Start with a view of the roiling skies of Char crisscrossed by the fiery streaks of ships burning up. Pan down to Raynor and Tychus standing near the battle-console as fire rains down all over the hellish world.  Tychus regards the console - as if studying tactical data. Both dudes are weary - barely on their feet. Gunfire and explosions rattle off left and right. 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00002=Cut to Raynor
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00004= Camera pulls back out to a normal shot of Tychus.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00005=Raynor shakes it off. Camera cuts to the tactical console as map images appear. We see groups of burning ships and units scattered across the map.

Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00009=As we pan, more drop pods enter the shot, on fire, and crash into the ground.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Comment00010=Pull back from the image -- reveal that we are watching the scrolling terrain on the briefing screen.

Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00001=Dammit! I told 'em a frontal assault wasn't goin' to work! She was playing with us the whole time! 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00002=Well, brother - we're alive at least. Looks like the few battle-groups that did make it to the surface are scattered all over the place.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00004=Do you think death is the worst thing that can happen to you here?
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00005=Soon all will serve the swarm!
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00006=She's tryin' to get in our heads, man. We gotta keep it together! 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00007=If we're gonna pull this caper off, we need to rally as many survivors as we can. 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00008=Commander, Dominion battle-groups are still landing all around you but they're in pretty bad shape and coming under heavy attack from the zerg.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00009=Alright, let's get out there and rescue their sorry butts!  We need to pull together a real fighting force - or we won't have a prayer of stopping Kerrigan!

Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00048=Right between the eyes!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00049=Say goodnight, ugly.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00050=You won't feel a thing.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00051=Lights out!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00052=This is it. Swann, I've marked the fault line with a flare, plant one of those charges near it.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00053=The charges are ready to blow, get the hell out of here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00054=Good job. That's the first charge, when we get all three, the chamber will flood with lava.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00055=Quit hoggin' all the fun, Jimmy. Lemme try out these shredder grenades...
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00056=Betty here'll roast 'em good.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00057=How'd you like them apples, huh?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00058=Extra crispy!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00059=Smells like....victory!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00060=Say hello to my little friend!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00061=Who's your daddy?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00062=Time to kick ass!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00063=I'm all outta bubble gum!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00064=Over here! Help us!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00065=Just one more charge and we're gonna have ourselves a Nydus barbeque. Stay sharp, boys.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00066=Y'know, the way those eggs all hatched...It's like they were waiting for us.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00067=There's a strong likelihood that another zerg creature was controlling them.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00068=Gah. Whatever's poppin' those eggs is gonna be in a world o' hurt when I get a hold of 'em!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00069=Thanks, man. I thought we were goners.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00070=All set, cowboy. When this thing goes off we need to be a long way from here.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00071=Least there's plenty of open space, clear fields of ---
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00072=What the hell is that?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00073=No life signs... She's dead, Jim!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00074=Us too if we don't get the hell out of here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00075=The charges are countin' down, hotshot, damn straight we gotta go! Here, Betty'll keep 'em busy!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00076=Big or small don't matter none. Just kill zerg wherever, whenever you can.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00077=Whoa, did you see the size of that mother? 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00078=Sure are some ugly suckers down here. 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00079=Yes -- well. What can I say?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00080=Let's get the hell outta here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00081=You got it, cowboy.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00082=Ah worms. Right.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00083=Thanks for the advice, son. Now shut up.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00084=Zerg are so fascinating. I wish we knew more about their physiology.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00085=I know all about 'em. Put a bullet in 'em, they die.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00086=Well, that's not exactly --
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00087=Shut it you two.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00088=Jimmy, you need stuff fixed, I'm your guy. This crawlin' around in caves... that guy I ain't.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00089=Swann, if I didn't know better, I'd say you're scared!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00090=Yellow. I knew it.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00091=It ain't that. Just... weapons, tools, they make sense to me. Caves and zerg, just ain't my cup of tea.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00092=Well. I'm scared.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00093=They're destroying the seismic charges. We gotta stop 'em!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00094=Take it easy sparky.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00095=Light 'em up.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00096=Ahhh!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00097=You ain't safe yet.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00098=Watch it! Infestor pods!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00099=Hot damn! Nothing like a good ol' fashioned knock-down-drag-out brawl!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00100=Look at all those caves crumble. Ain't sorry to see 'em go.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00101=Wow. We sure killed a lot of them. I bet they're really scared of us now. Of you.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00102=Alright, let's see how the boys held up while we were gone.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00103=Alright let's keep this quick and easy. Move out boys.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Comment00001=Takes place on Char battlefield. Tychus, Raynor and Warfield are present. They're looking at the lap top, the Adjutant is on-screen.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Comment00002=Show a fog of war version of the map with pings for the nuke sites.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Comment00003=Cut away from the holo to Warfield
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Comment00004=Comment
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Group00001=TValerian02A Briefing
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00001=Deep scan analysis has detected three fault lines converging beneath this area. Detonation of seismic charges in all three locations will redirect lava into the adjacent caverns. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00002=Any intel on what we'll be facing down there?
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00003=Negative, Commander. The intervening rock layers prevent accurate detection of zerg bio-signatures. Caution is advised.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00004=We're gonna need some more boys to carry the charges, if nothing else.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00005=I've been in these tunnels before. The more guys we take, the riskier it gets. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00006=I might have just the men for you. Some of my best; all decorated combat veterans with lousy discipline records. You'll love 'em.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00007=Sounds good, General, but I got my own crew for this. 'Sides, does 'em good to get outside once in a while.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00008=Alright, you do that - but I can't guarantee anything. This ain't no rescue mission. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00009=Some squads took cover in the tunnels during the landing so you might be able to find some reinforcements down there. I'll contact you if I detect their transponders.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00010=Alright then. Waitin' around ain't gonna make this any easier. Let's get to work.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00011=I'd rather bring a smaller, more experienced crew down there than a whole regiment.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Comment00001=As the first creep/infested areas come into view.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Comment00002=Our heroes are extracted and fly away from the platform. Behind them the platform tumbles into the atmosphere of Char and burns/explodes.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Comment00003=Coolant Towers -- The Coolant Towers prevent each platform from overheating. Destroy the towers and the heat will destroy the platform, along with anything nearby.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Comment00004=The Platforms are completely infested by zerg and virtually indestructible. Destroying the Coolant Towers on each platform will cause the platforms to overheat and burn up.

Conversation/TValerian02B/Group00017=Zerg behemoth arrives
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00001=Good work, the first coolant tower is destroyed. Remember - once we destroy the other tower on this platform we'll only have seconds to get clear!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00002=The platform's going critical! Evacuate it now! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00003=Damn Jimmy, this whole place is ...writhing!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00004=Once we blow those coolant towers it won't matter, the platforms'll burn up and kill everything on them.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00005=Ok, that's one tower down. 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00006=Commander, you should stay away from those tunnel entrances. According to the sensors they're chock full of Mutalisks.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00007=There are a lot of ground defenses on that platform, sir.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00008=I'm picking up signs of heavy air defences on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00009=It is possible to go around to the far side and flank the defenses on this platform sir. It'll give you a cleaner shot at the towers.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00010=The reactor's melting down! Move out! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00011=Evacuate the platform! Move it!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00012=I can't detect a land route to the next platform. Youll need an air force to take out the towers on this one.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00013=There she goes! Get clear!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00014=Last section. Once we knock down the towers here we're done.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00015=Great job, Raynor!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00016=Look at that thing.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00017=Unidentified zerg organism has arrived.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00018=Yeah....so any second now....any second...There it goes!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00019=Get out of there, sir!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00020=Move it, Raiders! Off the platform!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00021=You better move out - fast!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00022=It's getting ready to blow!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00023=Look at that thing.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00024=Raynor if you can take that thing down, we won't have to face it on the surface.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00025=That giant flier is patrolling the platform. Be careful.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00026=One more section to go! Then you're done!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00027=Sir, I'm scanning to get a positive fix on all the towers.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00028=Got it. I'll mark the tower coordinates on your map.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00029=Sir, we better finish off those towers before that giant zerg gets here.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00030=Good job on taking out those towers!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00031=The first waves of zerg are incoming. We can't extract you until they're gone.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00032=What!? You mean we're stuck on this thing? 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00033=Did ya think they were just gonna let us take off? Shut up and get ready to kill some damn zerg! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00034=The only way to stop zerg from coming out of those tunnels is to destroy the platforms!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00035=Warning. Unidentified zerg organism detected inbound. Largest on record.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00036=Damn, that's all we need! We better take that thing down or it's gonna cause some havoc!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00037=Look at her burn.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00038=I just hope it'll give us the edge we need. Kerrigan ain't goin' down without a fight...
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00039=Even for Char, this place is crawling with hostiles. Good luck, Raynor.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00040=Sensors show those vents are full of zerg fliers. Be careful.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00041=The only way to stop the zerg from coming out of those vents is to destroy the platforms
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00042=Scans show heavy air defenses on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00043=Scans are showing tough ground defenses on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00044=Tower's down! Now get away from it -- fast!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00045=Last section -- knock down this tower and we're done.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Comment00001=Takes place on Char battlefield. Tychus, Raynor and Warfield are present. They're looking at the lap top, a view of the mission map is on-screen.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Comment00002=The mission vid pings the locations of the zerg nests
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Comment00003=The mission vid highlights the COOLANT TOWERS on the platforms.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Comment00004=Cut back to Warfield, he nods.

Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Comment00006=The adjutant appears on one side of the holo screen.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Group00001=TValerian02B Briefing
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00001=The zerg fliers are using this old orbital platform as their base of operations. 
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00002=The nests are too deep inside to destroy with a bombardment, but clearing the whole thing with ground forces will be costly .
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00003=Adjutant, what's keeping that thing in orbit? Has it got power?
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00004=Affirmative. Thermal readings indicate intense heat coming from the platforms.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00005=Perfect. There's your answer, general. We get onboard and destroy the coolant towers on each section. 
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00006=Excellent plan. You missed your calling, Raynor, you would have made an outstanding staff officer.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00007=I reckon I'm right where I'm meant to be, general. Now let's get saddled up and hit that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00008=It's actually made up of several smaller platforms tethered together in geostationary orbit.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00009=The reactors'll go critical and take care of the zerg for us.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00010=Kerrigan won't be givin' us a second chance.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00011=Core temperatures are kept stable by a series of coolant towers, still operational despite the zerg infestation.
Conversation/TValerian03/Comment00001=Camera cuts to show Kerrigan entering the fray and destroying allied units. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Comment00002=Energy Nova goes off.
Conversation/TValerian03/Comment00005=A nydus worm opens up beneath her and she escapes back underground.
Conversation/TValerian03/Comment00007=Camera cuts to the artifact's location and Adjutant portrait pops on-screen. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Comment00008=Camera shows the artifact powering up and exploding in a WHITE LIGHT that floods the screen. Insane sound effects are heard.

Conversation/TValerian03/Line00005=The pain! Damn that cursed thing! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00006=Heads up, sir! I'm detecting a large group of zerg flyers heading straight for the artifact!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00007=That did it! Stay sharp boys, it won't be long before she's back for round two! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00008=Class 12 psionic waveform detected. The Queen of Blades has returned. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00009=The Queen of Blades is inbound. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00010=Warning! The Queen of Blades has commenced her attack. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00011=The Queen of Blades has been detected! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00012=Pathetic. Is this the best you've got?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00013=You fools should never have come here! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00014=I'll scour you all from my world! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00015=Humanity has seen its last days! I promise you that! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00016=I'll take my sweet time with these! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00017=You dare! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00018=Help me!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00019=Foretold.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00020=We've driven her back! Keep it up!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00021=I'll be back, you wretches!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00022=You will pay for this! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00023=You've got to stop her! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00024=As was foreseen.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00025=Kerrigan's gone underground! Pour it on, troops! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00026=Please just kill me!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00027=Cycles upon cycles.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00028=She's retreated again! Hold the line!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00029=The pain is unbearable!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00030=Kill her!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00031=Do not fear.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00032=She's on the run, man. Let's keep the pressure on!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00033=You will pay for this treachery!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00034=Don't give up!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00035=It begins.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00036=We've got her on the run! These zerg CAN be defeated! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00037=More zerg flyers inbound! They're coming in behind you, watch out!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00038=Warning. Seismic disturbance detected near the command center, Nydus worm inbound.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00039=Warning. Seismic disturbance detected. Nydus worm inbound.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00040=Sir, I'm picking up a mass of Overlords heading your way. Ready your air defenses!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00041=The artifact's energy is peaking! Just hold out a little longer!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00042=Commander, the zerg will try to overrun us soon. You should build bunkers and train more units as soon as possible. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00043=If things get out of hand use the energy nova to clear out your base. The recharge time is pretty fast so don't hesitate to use it.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00044=Lots of zerg flyers on their way to you, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00045=I told you there'd be no more free passes, Jim. Let this be a lesson to anyone who would defy me.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00046=You've brought me the Xel'Naga artifact - It was good of you to save me the trouble of finding it for myself.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00047=Sir we're tracking a large number of zerg flyers, coming your way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00048=I'm tired of working through others. It's time I took a personal hand in your demise.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00049=An impressive defense - but not nearly impressive enough.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00050=Ready for another round, lover? Here I come ready or not.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00051=Looks like I underestimated you. You always were a clever one.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00052=Is this your idea of bravery, Jim? Or is it just desperation?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00053=My forces are without number, and yours are dwindling by the minute. This can only end one way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00054=You fools. You're playing with forces beyond your comprehension!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00055=This is not... the end.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00056=Don't get in my way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00057=You want to play, little boy?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00058=You'll regret that.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00059=Do you know who I am?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00060=A pathetic attempt to distract me.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00061=You should really go and check on your base.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00062=(sighs) So predictable.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00063=Artifact power at full capacity.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00064=It's now or never, General! HIT IT!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00065=Another wave of zerg flyers, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00066=Warning. Class 10 zerg flier detected.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00067=Holy... Sir, scanners show the largest zerg bio-signature I've ever seen! And it's headed your way!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00068=Warning. Large zerg force incoming.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00069=We're not ready for this many. We'll have to use the artifact.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00070=Zerg everywhere! Sir, we should activate the artifact's nova!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00071=You're being overrun! Use the artifact, go nova!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00072=Might be a good time to use the artifact's nova, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00073=Sarah?

Conversation/TValerian03/Line00075=I hear Sarah...
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00077=The artifact is going to have to cool down before we can use it again. It shouldn't take long.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00078=Transferring control of the artifact to you sir.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00079=We need to down those Nydus worms or this is going to get ugly.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00001=Raynor, Tychus and Warfield are at the control point on the Char set. Warfield is hunched over the console - studying the battle schematics. Troops are firing at zerg in the distance. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00002=Camera cuts to Tychus.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00003=Camera cuts to Warfield:
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00004=Camera cuts to the battlefield/map view. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00005=We see the artifact get 'activated' - as zerg start racing towards it from off-screen. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00006=As they (we) watch the defenders fight the zerg - Raynor pipes in. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00008=The camera cuts ominously towards the evil looming hive cluster...
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Comment00009=Show the energy nova go off and devastate the zerg.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Group00001=TValerian03
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00001=The engineer corps is moving the Xel'Naga artifact to the base of the primary hive cluster. We'll entrench the last of our defenses all around it. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00002=Unfortunately, it's going to take some time to charge up the device for a strike against the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00003=You can bet the zerg'll be all over it the second we turn it on. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00004=You're more right than you realize
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00005=Intel provided by the Moebius Foundation suggests that the zerg will be attracted by the artifact's pulse-emanations. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00006=Once it's activated, all nearby zerg will go into a frenzy trying to reach it. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00007=There's no way we can beat a sustained zerg attack with what we've got left. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00008=Recharge or no I'll take all the help we can get right now, General.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00009=You'll have to activate the energy nova manually. Fortunately, it pulses on a sub-sonic frequency, so we'll be immune to its effects.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00010=Remember - Kerrigan's still out there waiting for us. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00011=How could we forget? 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00012=The artifact itself may help with that. According to intel it can discharge what they're calling an 'energy nova' that should kill any zerg within its radius.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00013=It takes time to recharge after each use, otherwise this'd be easy.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00014=(impressed) Whoa!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00001=TIP - Use Zeratul's Blink ability to teleport across the chasm.

Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00017=The stalkers blink across a chasm to avoid fighting the zerg. The zerg engage Zeratul and his forces, while the Stalkers attack from a safe distance.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00018=Zerg are killed off.

Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00001=It is an honor, great one!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00002=Fascinating, but these are just fragments of the prophecy. I must continue my search.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00003=The foreboding prophecy weighs heavily on my heart. I'd best reach the remaining shrines before she reconsiders letting me live.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00004=Gods, what does it all mean?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00005=Fragments of truth, perhaps. I cannot decipher the prophecy on my own. Yet I know who might interpret these findings for us - the Preservers of Zhakul!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00006=The holy Archives have been sealed off for a thousand years. What makes you think the Preservers will heed your plea now?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00007=Because if they do not... this entire universe will burn. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00008=Spore crawlers can detect my presence! A few well-placed void spheres will dispatch them easily enough! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00009=En Taro Tassadar, Zeratul! We received your transponder signal. Many of our brothers are still searching for you across this wasteland. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00010=Let us find them, young zealot. There is much to be done before we depart this place.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00011=(telepathic - in his head) Why not surrender yourself to oblivion, Zeratul? Wouldn't it be better to end your struggle now than witness the final agonizing moments of your species?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00012=These nydus worms must be destroyed or the zerg reinforcements will overwhelm us!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00013=You might peel away the prophecy's layers, Zeratul - but you cannot outrun the doom that awaits us all!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00014=That Overseer will alert the zerg! Stalkers! Kill it! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00015=Spine Crawlers! Kill them before they can take root and attack!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00016=Prelate Zeratul! At last! Fortune smiles upon us. I am Arch-Templar Karass. Hierarch Artanis sent me here to find you. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00017=Greetings, Karass. Aid me in my quest, and we shall return to Artanis together! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00018=These symbols... so similar to those in the caverns below. "The Cycle draws to its end"... And here, it speaks of the "Stars waking from celestial courses"... 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00019=This shrine has etchings like the others... Some reference here to "a Great Devourer consuming all hope"... and more about a "final darkness..." 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00020=More inscriptions. They speak of  "the stars being consumed by a vast shadow"... Grim portents. But here - a final inscription speaks of "another... who will break the cycle of the gods..." 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00021=More Zerg! Ready yourselves my brothers, this battle will be a bloody one.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00022=Perhaps not, prelate. Permit me to clear the way with a psionic storm.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00023=Careful now. Kerrigan has set guards to bar our way. It could be a trap.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00024=We are trapped! Unless....Karass, lend me your strength -- between us we can forge a means of escape!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00025=I do not understand, great one, how?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00026=The power of the Void and the Khala together! The twilight energies will be our salvation -- now focus!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00027=The second fragment of the prophecy! My task is nearly complete.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00028=So much for Kerrigan's reprieve!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00029=Permit us to destroy their defenses before we proceed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00030=That spore crawler can detect me from across the chasm. It must be destroyed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00031=The Queen of Blades built hatcheries here! She seeks to subvert this sacred world. (Beat) I shall put an end to that plan.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00032=Did you find what you sought, Zeratul?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00033=This chasm is vast. It is fortunate that I can phase through the shadows to the other side!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00034=If you can so easily read my mind, Kerrigan - you'll see that I'll never give up so long as hope remains! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00035=Your hope is an illusion, old fool. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00036=The rest is obscured... what??
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00037=We require assistance!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00038=Quickly brothers! Protect the Stalkers! Guard their flank to prevent the zerg from surrounding them!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00039=Our thanks, exalted one. We are yours to command.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00040=This hatchery must be destroyed if I am to keep the Queen of Blades from subverting this land.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00041=We cannot prevail against so many!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00042=The Queen of Blades seeks to pervert this world with that hatchery. I must destroy it!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00043=It is done. All of Kerrigan's hatcheries are destroyed. There is yet hope for this world.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00044=I must get to the Void Seeker and preserve the prophecy. I will not let my brothers' sacrifice be in vain.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00045=The prophecy must be saved. I will take it to the Void Seeker and leave this world.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00046=The prophecy was divided into fragments, each kept at separate shrines. I must gather them and depart this world quickly.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00047=The first fragment of the prophecy! Soon all will be made clear.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00048=The final piece of the prophecy. It speaks of one who shall "...break the cycle of the gods..."
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00049=For Shakuras!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00050=Greetings, exalted one. We are here in the service of High Templar Karass. He is nearby.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00051=Your presence is most welcome. Let us keep moving.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00052=Protoss... here? Quickly brothers, let us aid them!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00053=En Taro Tassadar, Prelate Zeratul! I am High Templar Karass.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00054=Kerrigan and I were both drawn here to uncover an ancient prophecy. With your aid, I pray we can discover it before her.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00055=It is an honor, great one! Lead on.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00056=Most ominous. But if the Queen of Blades seeks this prophecy, we must keep it from her.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00057=I will stand against the Queen of Blades while you escape with the fragments!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00058=I will not abandon you!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00059=The prophecy is more important than either of us! Reveal its secrets, Zeratul! The future rests on it!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00060=Your sacrifice will not be forgotten, Brother.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00062=Now... I shall become one... with the khala.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00063=I must get to the Void Seeker before the zerg overwhelm me and the prophecy is lost!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00064=I cannot decipher the fragments on my own. Yet I know who might interpret them: the Preservers of Zhakul.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00065=If they cannot... I fear this entire universe will burn.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00066=My force tracked the Queen of Blades to this world -- yet we know not what she seeks.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00067=High Templar Karass is nearby.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00068=That Overseer can see through my cloak. I'd best stun it with my Void Prison before crossing this chasm.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00069=Spore crawlers can detect my presence! I should stun them with my Void Prison.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00070=That patrol of Brood Lords must be dealt with cautiously or we will be torn asunder.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00071=Prepare for an aerial attack. Brace yourselves my brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00072=The banelings spew acid when they die. Stalkers, take them out from a distance!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00073=We should take them out carefully, one at a time, or risk being overwhelmed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00074=I've placed the Ultralisk in a Void Prison. Bring it down, Karass!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00075=Zeratul! Can you destroy the airborne zerg?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00076=Stalkers! Take the high ground and support our brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00077=Zeratul has destroyed their worms -- press on!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00081=You've struggled so long, Zeratul. Give in. Come to me and I will send you to your rest, at long last.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Comment00001=The camera fades in to show Raynor standing before the glowing ihan crystal. He looks tense.

Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00002=Friend Raynor... long has it been since we stood together against the Swarm.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00003=My sojourn led me to a remote world known as Ulaan...
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00004=...where I discovered fragments of the prophecy. Yet I was not the first to find them.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00007=Since then I have wandered the Void in solitude - seeking an ancient prophecy rumored to foretell the return of the Xel'Naga.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00009=It falls to you now, old friend... to relive my memories... and believe.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00001=The Void Seeker flies over to the landing site. Zeratul unloads and looks around.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00002=A stalker appears near the unpowered buildings.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00003=The vault opens up and the spirit of Preserver 1 arises and addresses the player. Preservers 2 and 3 emerge behind it.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00004=The preservers warn zeratul telepathically
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00005=The Archival Nexus. It starts out dark but flares into blinding life as we watch. A HYBRID is briefly silhouetted as it teleports in. We're left with an impression of burning eyes...

Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00017=The spectral Preservers fade away as the camera cuts back to Zeratul and his crew. 
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00018=As Zeratul's force approach, several dark templar appear.

Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00004=The Preservers you seek serve a higher power now, dark one.

Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00028=Cherish your FINAL moments. DEATH comes.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00029=A Robotics Facility! This structure may prove useful to us.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00031=My thanks, mighty one.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00032=Your existence ENDS this day.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00033=Zeratul...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00034=The hybrid is draining the preservers to survive! I must free them before it is too late!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00035=Our thanks, Dark One.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00036=Now that we are free...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00037=A... protoss and zerg hybrid... Gods, an abomination! Who created this atrocity?
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00038=Perhaps not all, but even one is too many.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00039=We have seen the prophetic fragments in your mind, Zeratul. We will make of them what we can.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00040=The Cycle shall draw to its end. The Xel'Naga who forged the stars will transcend their creation...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00041=Yet, the Fallen One shall remain...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00042=Destined to cover the Void in shadow...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00043=It begins with the Great Hungerer.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00044=A Great Hungerer... could it refer to the zerg Overmind? It has a part to play in this prophecy?
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00045=Zeratul! Truly fate has sent you here.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00046=Join me, brothers, and we shall cleanse this place of evil.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00047=Command us!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00048=Come, my slaves. The time has come to give me your strength.

Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00051=Strike! Destroy the hybrid once and for all!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00052=Greetings, brother. We come seeking the Preservers.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00053=They serve a higher power now, dark one.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00054=This templar archive lies abandoned!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00055=Come, my SLAVES. The time has come to give me your STRENGTH.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00056=SACRIFICE yourselves to me, and live FOREVER.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00057=It keeps the preservers in bondage, feeding off their power! If we are to transcribe the prophecy, they must be freed!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00058=En Taro Tassadar. Do not forget, more information on managing a protoss base and army can be found in the tutorial section.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00059=Beware--
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00060=The shadow draws near!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00061=Our liberation is at hand!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00062=It ends... in utter darkness.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00063=I must seek out the Overmind's final resting place. Our ancient homeworld... of Aiur.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00064=The Hybrid grows stronger! We must destroy the preserver prisons before it is too late!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00065=We must free the Preservers before we can destroy the Hybrid!

Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00001=The camera fades in to show Raynor standing before the glowing ihan crystal. 
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00002=Camera cuts back to the object as Zeratul's 'head' swirls into view (through holo-projection).  
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00003=The camera cuts to show the mission MAP. As it pans - we see the three Archive-vaults, and the protoss units that guard them. We see the three Preservers (each spectral form glowing white, blue and violet, respectively)
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00004=Camera cuts to the starting area - where drones are building a base. 
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00005=Camera cuts back to Zeratul:
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Group00001=TZeratul02 Briefing
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00001=Alright Zeratul, old buddy -- you got your mysterious prophecy. Now let's see what your Preservers made of it.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00002=My quest to decipher the prophecy took me to the forbidden archive world of Zhakul.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00003=Only they could transcribe the prophetic fragments. I needed to seek them out quickly.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00004=Here, three immortal Preservers guarded ancient knowledge.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00001=After Zeratul kills one - power up!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00002=Zeratul activates the waygate. A number of protoss units emerge from its energy matrix. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00003=A squad of colossi arrive. They are magnificent. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00004=The camera cuts away to a pre-built zerg creep-out area. We are in heavy shadow. In the HEAVY RED LIGHT we see a few zerg larvae creeping around in the muck. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00005= We see the larva enter its egg state. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00006= We see the egg explode as a zerglings crawls out. It sniffs the air (or emotes somehow).   
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00007=A wave of additional zerglings race up behind the first one and charge across the screen. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00008= The first zerglings emotes and then starts running with them as the camera pans up and around the swarming creatures. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00009=The visions ends... we cut back to Zeratul standing near the tendril node.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00010=The camera cuts away to a view of SPACE. Through HEAVY RED LIGHT we see a swarm of zerg flyers moving slowly across a star field. The camera pans around them - showing their alien grace and majesty as a swarm. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00011=Camera swings around to show the space BEHIND this swarm... there we see DEAD WORLDS behind them... Could be 2D - gray/lifeless - or aflame (whatever)... we want to show the swarm as hugely destructive.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00012= The camera cuts to show a worm-hole SLOWLY open up before the swarm (similar to the Zerg victory flic <n/>in Star1 - this will use the 'black hole' Mothership spell art). The zerg 'get pulled in' to the black hole as if <n/>using it as a wormhole for travel...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00013=All the zerg 'teleport' through the wormhole - leaving only silent stars before us. The scene starts to go black. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00014= Camera cuts back to Zeratul as he stands before the tendril node. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00015=The camera cuts away to a zerg 'room' - a dark chamber covered with CREEP. HEAVY RED LIGHT and shadow... the camera slowly pans around the room... A strong heartbeat is heard echoing throughout the chamber.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00016=Camera stops tracking at the center of the room - as we see a CHRYSALIS (similar to Star1). 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00017= Camera starts zooming in towards the chrysalis. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00018=The chrysalis begins to warp and flex - something is tearing its way out. The heartbeat is faster - thundering now. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00019= We see KERRIGAN arise from the Chrysalis. The camera slowly pans around her form - revealing her majesty. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00020= We see tons of zerg rushing at her - swarming around her as their new queen. Camera cuts back to Zeratul.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00021=Zeratul enters and sees... Tassadar.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00022=The camera pans down to the scenes as the combat gets nasty. We see GANTRITHOR flying on-screen as in the BRIEFING. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00023=The camera pans down to the scenes as the combat gets nasty. We see GANTRITHOR flying on-screen as in the BRIEFING. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00024=As the camera spirals to the ground (tracking Gantrithor), there is a FLASH of white light. The camera slowly fades back in to show Kerrigan standing on the battlefield as zerg swarm around her. Camera pans down toward her as she unleashes her powers against the protoss forces. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00025=The whole scene starts fading to black. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00026=Cut back to Zeratul.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00027=Zeratul takes a step back.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00028=FADE TO WHITE
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00029=---  Zerg drop pods start hammering down on the planet in the nearby area, dropping off dozens of zerglings.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00030=Colossi engage
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00031=New unit acquired - Observers are robotic aerial spies that can detect burrowed zerg. They cannot attack, but are afforded protection by a permanent cloaking field.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00032=New unit acquired -  Colossi are strong against ground based forces but vulnerable to air units. They have the ability to walk up and down cliffs.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00033=Warp In - Warp Gates allow you to create units faster than ordinary gateways and deploy them to any place with pylon power.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00034=Zeratul takes a step back.

Conversation/TZeratul03/Group00026=OBSOLETE
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00001=The zerg will keep coming until we are dead. I must find the Overmind's cortex and discover what I can from it.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00002=These creatures seem to be feeding off the husk's ambient psionic energy. Fascinating. Some memories may yet remain!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00003= Ah - the creatures' energies feed my own! That could prove useful. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00004=These warp gates appear to be functional. Perhaps there's a chance...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00005=Adun Toridas, Zeratul! We were trapped within the gate's energy matrix when it was deactivated! You have our thanks!  
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00006=The zerg perceive a threat to their dead master!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00007=Ah! I've heard tales of the mighty colossi sealed away beneath Aiur! The beacon must have awoken these fearsome guardians!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00008=The first tendril node! Gods willing, some trace of the Overmind remains...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00009=Zerg. This is the first expression of all that I am.  
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00010=The perfect design...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00011=Bred to assimilate the strongest species...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00012=A perfect genetic ferocity...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00013=Driven by a perfect, single-minded will...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00014=I have glimpsed the Overmind's origins... but there must be more! I must keep moving. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00015=The second tendril node! I must make contact quickly! 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00016=Long did the Swarm wander the void...Assimilating the lesser species it encountered.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00017=I was driven by the deepest manipulations of the Xel'Naga - to find and assimilate their first born...their failed children...the protoss.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00018=I was nothing more than an instrument to the Xel'Naga...The Swarm was the raging fire that would consume the evidence of their sins.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00019=But what of my children? Would they have no future of their own?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00020=The Overmind seemed almost... selfless. I must press on. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00021=The third node at last! 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00022=The Xel'Naga had created me to eradicate their failed children - the protoss - in a battle neither species would survive.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00023=I could do nothing...but obey.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00024=Yet I deemed the purity of the Swarm was greater than my function - greater even than the Creators' Pyrrhic vision. I would birth...an inheritor.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00025=One who would give the Swarm its freedom.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00026=And help it to...evolve.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00027=Kerrigan. (beat) Could the Overmind have created her... to stop the Xel'Naga's return? 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00028=The final tendril node... Gods, grant me the answers I seek. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00029=I made my war against the first born as I was destined to.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00030=Before I could assimilate the protoss - I was undone.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00031=Yet my...daughter...remained. She alone would break the cycle. She alone would forge a future devoid of the hated Xel'Naga.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00032=She alone would lead the Swarm ...into tomorrow.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00033=I can scarcely believe what I have seen. What terrible irony - that the wretched Queen of Blades... is the key to saving all who live. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00034=The zerg are coming!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00035=The zerg seek to overwhelm our base!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00036=The zerg are massing near our base!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00037=If we use our Observers wisely, we can scout the area before putting ourselves at risk.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00038=The zerg seek to overwhelm us! To arms, my brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00039=The colossi are mighty foes against the zerg on the ground, but I fear they will need protection against airborne threats such as mutalisks.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00040=Ah, this faithful Observer has kept watch since the evacuation. Its abilities will certainly prove useful now.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00041=This ancient beacon still thrums with power. I wonder...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00042=Our base falls under a shadow -- the zerg will attack soon.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00043=I must find a way to establish a foothold and summon reinforcements to keep the zerg at bay!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00044=Some of these abandoned structures remain functional... we shall make use of them.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00045=We must be prepared to defend our base. The zerg are on the move.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00046=The first Overmind tendril!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00047=I sense... pain. Surprise. Death.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00048=The second Overmind tendril. I sense... death... and joy?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00049=The third Overmind tendril. I sense... satisfaction... in a plan set in motion long ago... and... fear of the future?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00050=The fourth Overmind tendril. I sense... an end. I must go to the Overmind Cortex to understand.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00051=The Overmind's cortex. If any trace impulse of the foul creature remains, it will be found here.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00052=Tassadar! But... you died... slaying this cursed Overmind!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00053=I have never tasted death, Zeratul -- nor shall I. But that is a tale for another time. I have come to tell you of this creature's... courage.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00054=Courage? It was an abomination!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00055=Not always. The zerg were... altered. A single over-riding purpose was forced upon them: the destruction of our people. (half of the sound in this line belongs on the next.)
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00056=Who did this? Why?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00057=I know not. But the Overmind found a way to resist its all-consuming directive. It created a chance... a hope of salvation.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00058=Madness!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00059=Only she can free the zerg from slavery -- and in so doing, save all that is... from the flame.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00060=I do not understand, brother.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00061=Forget what you know, Zeratul. The Overmind saw a vision... the end of all things. (beat) And now you must see it too.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00062=No! This vision! I cannot bear it, stop!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00064=Overmind! Trace impulses of the foul creature do linger!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00066=Who did this?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00068=I care nothing for your hopes. Tell me of the prophecy, damn you!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00070=The Queen of Blades? Madness!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00072=No! This vision! I cannot bear it, stop!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00073=Greetings, brother. I speak to you... from the Beyond.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00074=The Queen of Blades.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00075=The Overmind was formed with thought and reason... but not free will. It screamed and raged within the prison of its own mind.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00001= We see Raynor standing before the ihan crystal, pondering. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00002= Camera cuts to the crystal where we see Zeratul's swirly visage before us. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00003= Camera cuts to show THE PAST- where the Overmind (alive and well) sits atop the fields of Aiur. As Zeratul speaks, we see the Gantrithor (brisling with twilight energy) careening down towards it. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00004= The screen FLASHES WHITE (suggesting the catastrophic impact when the ship hit the Overmind). The camera cuts back to PRESENT DAY - the Overmind is now just a massive, rotting HUSK. The sky is red... zerg swarm everywhere...
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00005= Camera begins to pan across the map to show the various 'tendril nodes'...
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00006=Camera cuts to show masses of zerg creepies swarming around the nodes as defenders - almost feeding off the dead remains.

Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00002=At the very apex of its victory against us, the zerg Overmind grew... overconfident.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00004=Now, all that was left of the mighty Overmind was a twisted, withered husk.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00006=Yet its countless minions, which seemed to be feeding from its dead husk, would prove somewhat... problematic. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00007=I needed to understand whatever memories lingered within the creature's rotting mass.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00008=Only by making contact with the gargantuan tendrils connected directly to its cortex could I learn its secrets.

Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00012=Foolish, prideful children...There was one among you who could have jeopardized my great plan... but in your recklessness -- you mistook her for the true threat!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00013=The Queen of Blades... how could we have known?
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00014=The zerg performed their function as I planned...My Hybrid are proof of this. Now, the last of the protoss will fulfill their function...In death!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00015=Oblivion is all that awaits you.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00016=As I was your beginning - so shall I be... your end. 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00017=I will feast on your souls.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00018=Feel the cold embrace of death.

Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00026=Kerrigan... how could we have known...
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00027=My brethren, hear me! For there is little time left. All that remains of our race, our civilization, are those that stand beside you now.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00028=Your light is expended. It is finished.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00029=All shall be remade in my name! Behold my greatest creation!

Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00034=Great one, the vault is prepared. Guard us while we preserve our knowledge for those that may follow. They must not make the mistakes we did.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00035=Trust in each other. Strike as one will! Let our last stand burn a memory so bright, we will be remembered forever! En taro Tassadar!

Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00002= The camera cuts away to show a ferocious battle being waged across an unknown world. An oppressive RED HAZE hangs over the maps as we pan down to see a massive PROTOSS BASE being attacked by super-powered HYBRID. Though seen only distantly, it's clear the hybrid are whomping the snot out of the protoss. 
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00003= Camera cuts to show the hybrid in action. They are terrifying and majestic all at once. 
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00004= The camera cuts away to show massive explosions of psionic energy ripping up the base. Massive psi-storms are being unleashed across the map. The onslaught is overwhelming.  
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00005= A massive shockwave rocks the protoss base as the camera comes to settle on Zeratul. 
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Group00001=TZeratul04 Briefing
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00001=I don't think I want to see any vision of the Overmind's... (sighs) But if Kerrigan's involved... I need to know.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00008=All will bow before the power... of the Fallen One.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00009=On a distant, shadowed world, the protoss will make their final stand. Their heroes will gather, their forces will be marshaled, and they will die bravely. But still, they will die.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00010=And my zerg... will be slaves... to the hybrid.

Conversation/Valerian/Line00002=Alright, kid. You've got a deal. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00003=This is a dangerous game you're playing, kid. What's your stake in all this?
Conversation/Valerian/Line00004=You're the only man who's been close to her and lived to tell the tale. You know her tactics, you know her strategies - and I know you'd risk anything for the chance to bring her back. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00005=Jim. I really think we should --
Conversation/Valerian/Line00006=I can see why my father wants to kill you.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00007=The artifact fragments you've been collecting are of Xel'Naga origin. With them, I can construct a device that will reverse the infestation that transformed Kerrigan into the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00008=Way I heard it, they created both the protoss and the zerg millions of years ago.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00009=I asked you a question.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00010=Everyone wonders if I will be as good an emperor as my father. But I want something more. To prove that I will be a better emperor. And a better man.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00011=That shouldn't be hard.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00012=If I reform the worst mass murderer in history, make her human again... teamed with the famous outlaw Jim Raynor... it's all the proof I'll need.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00013=Somethin' on your mind, Valerian? 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00014=I just wanted to congratulate you, Commander. I doubt there's anyone alive that could have turned our calamitous invasion into a victory. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00015=We ain't achieved victory yet. And if I know Kerrigan, the worst is still to come.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00016=(haunted) I didn't anticipate her reacting so quickly. She seems to be a... fierce opponent. Perhaps we wouldn't have lost so many men if I'd--
Conversation/Valerian/Line00017=Now ain't the time for second guessing, junior. If we survive what's next, you'll have the whole rest of your life to wallow in guilt. For now, we buck up and get 'er done. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00018=Indeed they did. And once certain key artifacts are collected together, I can construct a device that will reverse the infestation that transformed Kerrigan into the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00019=Even if that were possible, she holes up in the main hive cluster on Char - protected by a billion screaming zerg. How're you going to get that thing anywhere near her? 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00020=(Chuckles) Oh not me, Commander - you. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00021=So I'm just a cog in your machine.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00022=If it gets you what you want, do you care?
Conversation/Valerian/Line00023=Guess I don't.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00028=Well, junior, we got our hands on the final artifact. You can take possession of the whole set at any time.  
Conversation/Valerian/Line00029=Thank you, Commander, and well done. You're every bit as resourceful as I've been led to believe. I think the odds are stacking in our favor.  
Conversation/Valerian/Line00030=You better hope so. Delivering this... artifact thing right to Kerrigan's doorstep - we're gonna need all the luck we can get.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00031=Rest easy. We'll have the might of the Dominion Fleet behind us!

Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00002=Actually, Commander, that painting depicts my grandfather, Angus Mengsk. It was a gift from his constituents on Korhal who honored his crusade against the vile Confederacy. 
Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00003=You've got some mighty big boots to fill, junior. In the end, the struggle for power killed your granddad and turned your daddy into a monster. You sure you know what you're getting into?

Conversation/Valerianfidgetswindow/Line00003=By achieving what he never could, I will prove my right to succeed him as ruler of the Dominion.
Conversation/Valerianfidgetswindow/Line00004=You're a Mengsk alright. 'Least now I know what your stake in all this is.
Conversation/Valerianfidgetswindow/Line00005=Do not mistake me for my father, Commander. There is little love lost between us. 
Conversation/Valerianfidgetswindow/Line00006=I would undo the worst of his excesses and usher in a new era of freedom and prosperity. But to achieve that, the Queen of Blades must be neutralized.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryBanshee/Info/Description 2=Created by the Dominion military to terrorize rebellious colonists, the banshee was used to great effect in urban and rural settings. Its agile, sneaky capabilities quickly propelled it onto the front lines against zerg, protoss, and terran foes.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryBanshee/Info/Description 3=The DN51 banshee cloak generator is one of the most sophisticated pieces of equipment in the Dominion arsenal. When a banshee is shot down, special teams are deployed to recover the generator -- or destroy it.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 2=The firebat suit contains a volatile mix of gasses that seep into the operator compartment. This may explain why firebat personnel are almost universally resocialized criminals or psychotic pyromaniacs.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 3=Perdition flamethrowers spew combusto-plasma at enemy targets. The plasma easily seeps into gaps in zerg carapaces. Smaller zerg creatures are literally cooked alive inside their own skins.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 2=Introduced by the Confederacy shortly before the fall of Tarsonis, the Mark VI is considered the pinnacle of ghost antipersonnel weaponry. The Dominion, unable to improve upon the design, has carried on production.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 3=Despite their great skill, ghosts are notoriously sloppy when calling down nuclear strikes. Modern commanders are always happy to see a ghost's rifle, for it contains a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryMarauder/Info/Description 3=The marauder's grenade auto-loader is stocked with component parts that allow it to quickly manufacture and load hundreds of standard Punisher grenades.

She later murdered two marines who reportedly insisted on referring to the medivac as a "heal bus." <n/><n/>She is rumored to be resocialized and serving happily in the Dominion military.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryMedivac/Info/Description 2=Medics of the 19th Dominion Marine Division first improvised the medivac by modifying a dropship to allow remote control during the acid storms on Thalon VII. This added tens of minutes to the life expectancy of medics.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryMedivac/Info/Description 3=Marines still do not trust the accuracy of the scalpel laser, nor are they optimistic about the precision of the auto-suture, both of which were developed by Procyon Industries, the lowest bidder.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySiegeTank/Info/Description 2=Armed with twin 90mm cannons, the Crucio is an expensive upgrade to the original Arclite siege tank. The 180mm "siege mode" shock cannon scatters superheated tungsten in a 50% larger area.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySiegeTank/Info/Description 3=Dominion infantry soldiers are universally convinced that Crucio operators inflict more damage on friendly forces than on the enemy. Consequently, Crucio operators stick together during shore leave.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySpectreCrates/Info/Description 2=A side effect of the spectre training regimen is a marked increase in eccentricity. Many spectres carry totems or other trinkets to "enhance" their abilities.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySpectreCrates/Info/Description 3=There is speculation that the Dominion still uses spectres in a number of operations, despite the ostensible shutdown of the program.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmorySpiderMine/Info/Description 2=Spider mines belong to a very small category of technology that came from Old Earth and survived the crash of the supercarriers. Terran marines are famously mistrustful of the spider mines' IFF sensors.

A viking pilot is a "cherry" until he's been inside of one during a transformation. The twisting metal can kill less-agile men.<n/><n/>The elite few who make it through training are so deadly that their names are well-known by both allies and enemies across the sector.

ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description=<s val="Lab_Text">Protoss "crystal" sample recovered by Raynor's Raiders, 10.7.2504.<n/><n/>I placed the crystal in saline solution for storage. Its density has increased 553% in the last twelve hours. Where does it get energy or raw materials for that? I have a terrible suspicion that it's... connecting to the ship somehow. If Swann suspects, he'll drop it out the airlock, and that would be a tragedy. This sample could lead to huge breakthroughs for the Raiders.<n/> <n/>I just have to be careful, and if there's any sign that it will harm the Hyperion, I'll destroy the crystal myself.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 2=<s val="Lab_Text">The crystal is growing, and it appears to have something--some sort of... anti-matter? Gravitational anomaly? Non-standard phenomenon?--hovering over it. I'm now convinced that the crystal is drawing power from the ship, but in ways so subtle as to be undetectable. <n/><n/>It is non-organic but has a molecular structure as diverse and complex as any organism's. It's developed an intricate matrix that makes it tough and surprisingly flexible. An alloy based on this crystal would have impressive damage mitigation. The structure of this matrix also suggests some sort of energy-storage system. There might be something to this.<n/><n/>The protoss are so far beyond us. We must seem amoeboid to them.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 3=<s val="Lab_Text">The protoss crystal continues to grow. I no longer think it is drawing power from the ship. It's getting pure energy from that sphere above it, which presents a new worry. What's it doing with all that power? Is it going to release it explosively? I have to keep Swann away from the sample; he will definitely shoot it out the airlock. With me strapped to it.<n/><n/>I tried scraping smaller samples, but all my tools broke. Luckily, I found some cast-off chips floating in the tank. Wonder how they came off? In any case, the chips revealed more of the matrix. It's keeping the energy there in a vortex. How does it move the energy so fast? It may be the fabled protoss warp technology. For all its complexity, the matrix is as solid as the strongest structure. Hm, I wonder if I could apply these dynamics to our own structures? Make a note.<n/><n/>I'm learning so much from this crystal, but I can't help feeling as if it's learning from me, if that makes sense. Late. Tired. Sleep now.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 4=<s val="Lab_Text">I've been staring at that anomalous sphere above the crystal. It's obviously an energy emitter, but it has such strong containment that the crystal can slowly draw power from it via some method I don't understand. That gives me an idea: using our own containment technology, I could modify our SCV manufacturing process to double capacity with no increased risk. I think.<n/><n/>Breakthrough! The energy in this crystal is not kept in a vortex pattern. It was warping the energy around so fast that I couldn't detect it. In an odd coincidence, the warping slowed just enough for my sensors to pick it up. Not sure how or why. Every time I reach my wits' end with this sample, something happens by... chance... and I get a breakthrough.<n/><n/>Is it helping me? Clearly I've been working too many hours. I'm going to go lose some more credits on Lost Viking.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 5=<s val="Lab_Text">Okay, I may be exceeding the boundaries of good science, but I am now sure this crystal has some sort of... if not sentience, at least... direction. I put a broken nano-fabricator in the tank last night, and today it's fixed.  And it can accomplish things it shouldn't. If I can reverse engineer this fabricator, I could do amazing things with automated repair, or even near-instant manufacturing of advanced AI weaponry. Possibilities are limitless.<n/><n/>On the less upbeat end of things, the level of energy stored in the crystal's matrix has not increased at all, despite the fact that the crystal continues to grow. So it must be emitting that energy somehow, some... where.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 6=<s val="Lab_Text">All of the containment and reinforced structural integrity theorems I've developed from studying this crystal are starting to... well... crystallize. I think we might be able to contain energies that once required huge machines. Or even manufacture structures capable of hot landings from orbital origins with acceptable stresses.<n/><n/>I'm a sham. I haven't truly learned anything from this crystal. I've just observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when the crystal... helped me. I don't understand how the protoss can possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe. Perhaps they simply don't want to?<n/><n/>Last entry on this sample. I figured out where it is putting all that excess energy. It's feeding the Hyperion. Subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged systems. It's giving of itself, and has been since it got here. Swann is excited that the ship is running so well, but he has no idea why. And I'm not going to tell him.</s>

ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description=<s val="Lab_Text">Zerg sample recovered by Raynor's Raiders, 6.10.2504.<n/><n/>Sample appeared dead when brought in, including tissue necrosis. However, tests now reveal frantic cellular activity, and it is moving. <n/><n/>This defies everything I understand about biology. I'm tracking massive generational changes in each cell. In the last hour, this thing has evolved more than humans did in 100,000 years.<n/><n/>If I can harness this, it could lead to huge military innovations for the Raiders.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 2=<s val="Lab_Text">The recovered zerg sample is still growing. I introduced a protein solution. Might have been a mistake.<n/><n/>At the cellular level, the sample shows strains of every known zerg creature--and many other strains that I don't recognize. It will take a while to map it all, but I've already begun extracting data from an ultralisk cell, and I found a spore crawler cell that yielded data on its instinctive threat-recognition routines.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 3=<s val="Lab_Text">Recovered zerg sample continues to evolve. Clearly has motor function despite the lack of anything like a neural cortex. It's giving off more heat than it could possibly be absorbing in that tank.<n/><n/>I'm learning how some zerg burrow so well. It's extremely sophisticated. They have billions of tiny muscles that vibrate at a low frequency, effectively loosening soil, crumbling rock, and snapping vegetation. They can "swim" through the ground. It's not quite as fast as running, but it's close.<n/><n/>I can see a way to put this knowledge to good use.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 4=<s val="Lab_Text">The zerg sample has developed an ocular organ. Will limbs be next? There is a basic dichotomy to zerg cell reproduction. Type A cells throw off seemingly random mutations. Type B cells hunt down these mutations and destroy them. It's survival of the fittest on the cellular level. Successful mutations thrive.<n/><n/>I used microscopic scrapings from the sample to test an electrical discharge field I'd been tinkering with for some time. The results were gratifying. As an interesting side effect, the zerg matter developed into a very dense but flexible material. This material could be used to reinforce the superstructure of those old Hercules-class cargo ships that Swann's always trying to find a use for.<n/> <n/>I wish there were time to both pursue the discharge field and iterate on the hardened matter. I doubt there will be.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 5=<s val="Lab_Text">The zerg sample has developed a large neural cortex. I've noticed it reacting to external stimuli, but in a very disturbing way. When it detects my presence, it stops moving. Is it trying to "play dead"? Can it react at that level?<n/><n/>I noticed earlier that zerg alpha amino acids have unique R groups. I've run a full regimen on some. Results are stunning. Zerg aminos are able to combine dead cell matter with normal proteins to biosynthesize new cells. They don't suffer generational cell degradation. Simply put, a zerg will never die of old age. They can constantly renew themselves, albeit with radically changing cell structure.<n/><n/>We could never harness this for biological use with terrans: the results would be foregone and horrifying. But I wonder if I could alloy zerg tissue with some of our metals to make buildings that heal? The renewal process also throws off immense energy as a byproduct. Something there. I should see about harnessing that energy.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 6=<s val="Lab_Text">The sample is trying to escape. I've detected several new acids in the nutrient solution. Over time, they will crack the tank. I wonder if Commander Raynor can post some marines down here? No; he'll want to destroy it. I haven't learned everything I can from this thing yet.<n/><n/>Breakthrough. I dosed some tissue with concentrated sigma radiation, and it slowed growth and movement severely. It would take a lot of work to safely deploy that much radiation on the battlefield, but it might be worth it.<n/><n/>Another breakthrough, and this one scares me. I mapped my way through the DNA of some brain tissue, peering back thousands of years, and I isolated the strain from which the zerg Overmind was derived. Not enough to clone the Overmind, but I could follow this strand to gain insight into how it controlled the zerg.</s>
