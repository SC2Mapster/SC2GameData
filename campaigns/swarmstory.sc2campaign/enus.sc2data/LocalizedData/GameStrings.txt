ArmyUnit/Confirmation/ZergAAVariant=Are you sure you want to evolve to the ZergAAVariant?
ArmyUnit/Description/Corpser=Recovered scantipede essence. Scantipede itself unremarkable. Parasite within more interesting. Sequences allow roach to inject microscopic parasites. Acidic saliva melts away flesh. Allows parasite to burrow within host and gestate. Upon death, roachlings break free. Emerge from any available orifice. Extremely efficient.
ArmyUnit/Description/Hunter=Hunter strain, strategic asset. Extreme conditions used to guide evolution. Hunter strain can propel itself up cliffs, attack foes caught unawares. Able to leap over Swarm troops, bombard enemies. Banelings no longer trapped behind hungry zerglings.
ArmyUnit/Description/HydraliskImpaler=Impaler colony essence evolved millennia ago. First mutated under Overmind's instruction. Ancestor strain of sunken colony. Powerful.<n/><n/>Can bond essence to hydralisk morph, create impaler. Attacks single foe. Tentacle shreds through armor, flesh, bone.
ArmyUnit/Description/HydraliskLurker=Lurker evolved prior to inter-Swarm conflict. Essence abandoned by Queen of Blades in effort to assimilate new breeds. Almost lost. Now recovered. <n/><n/>Lurkers attack while burrowed. Spines strike multiple enemies at once. Effective against troops lacking sufficient armor.
ArmyUnit/Description/MutaliskBroodlord=Brood Lord strain almost lost. Corruptor strain unable to be reconstituted. Essence unavailable. Mutalisk base must suffice.<n/><n/>Once morphed, spawns broodling symbiotes. Able to launch broodlings long distance. Siege ground-based foes from air. Powerful weapon.
ArmyUnit/Description/MutaliskViper=Viper adapted from essence taken on Zerus. Primal sequences streamlined. Redundant mutations removed. Stronger. Fit for Swarm. Viper strain abducts targets, emits disabling cloud. Manipulates battlefield conditions to Swarm's advantage.
ArmyUnit/Description/Noxious=Dominion's compound, interesting. Scientists desired to pacify the Swarm, inadvertently created potent toxin. Deadly to any non-zerg entity. Noxious strain bonded permanently to toxins. Emits as poisonous vapor. Capable of channelling toxins and releasing in controlled blasts through vents in carapace.
ArmyUnit/Description/Raptor=Assimilation of karak essence, many benefits. Can enhance quadriceps of zergling, mutate wing function. Would allow zergling to vault through air, climb up and down cliffs, leap at foes from distance.<n/><n/>Minor side effect: amplified aggression. Likely to improve damage output. Acceptable.
ArmyUnit/Description/Splitterling=Decentralized nervous system of splitter strain increases efficiency at siege warfare. Upon detonation, two baneling spawn split from remains, continue pressing assault. Split only occurs once. Further splits invariably result in acidic fluids of limited sentience.

ArmyUnit/Description/Swarmling=Examination of feral sequences, completed. Random variations of Zz'gash dune-runner core reduced complexity. Gestation period almost nonexistent. Simple sequences allow production of three swarmlings from single cocoon. Dorsal protrusion of dune-runner has resurfaced. Prominent. Will examine further.
ArmyUnit/Description/Torrasque=Assimilation of infectious compound provided key to evolution of torrasque strain. Process requires exorbitant energy. Once, provided by Overmind. Now, energy result of tissues being devoured by compound. Upon death, torrasque strain enters cocoon. Uses energy to resuscitate tissues. Extremely resilient.
ArmyUnit/Description/Vile=Toxic ingestion, successful. Adaptation has produced powerful roach variant. Chemical byproducts of microbes altered compounds of acidic saliva. Constrictive agents will coat target as roach attacks. As newer layers apply, previous layers harden and tighten. Movement becomes difficult. Attacks less frequent. Debilitates enemies.

Map/LoadingHelp/ZChar1=Your progress is automatically saved at key points.<n/>If you're having trouble, you can load a saved game and try different tactics.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZChar2=Swarm Queens are essential to an effective army. They attack both ground and air targets, heal nearby units, and spawn Creep Tumors.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZChar3=Expanding to a new resource location allows you to speed up unit production and can give you a foothold closer to the front line.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionBaneling=Banelings are extremely effective against tightly grouped enemies.<n/>They're also good at breaking tough defenses.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionHydralisk=Hydralisks sacrifice toughness for a powerful ranged attack.<n/>Protect them with Roaches or Zerglings.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionMutalisk=Mutalisks are highly mobile.<n/>Try to exploit enemy weak spots instead of attacking head-on.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionRoach=You can Burrow and Unburrow an injured Roach to force the enemy to switch targets.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionSwarmHost=The Swarm Host's endless supply of Locusts is ideal to besiege powerful enemies and tear down tough defenses.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionUltralisk=Ultralisks are incredibly resilient. Keep them on the front line to protect your forces.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZEvolutionZergling=You can morph a large number of Zerglings very quickly.<n/>Use their numbers to overwhelm large enemies.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZExpedition1=Your progress is automatically saved at key points. If you have trouble, you can load from a checkpoint to quickly restart mid-mission.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZExpedition2=Ranged units are effective at focusing their attacks on a single target.<n/>Take advantage of this when you need to destroy something quickly.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZExpedition3=During certain missions you will control a hero other than Kerrigan.<n/>Use their unique abilities to defeat your enemies.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZHybrid1=Use your Infestors to take control of powerful enemies. Thors, Battlecruisers, and other Terran heavy ordnance make ideal targets.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZHybrid2=The Hybrid represent the best traits of both Zerg and Protoss.<n/>Their physical strength and psionic prowess should not be taken lightly.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZHybrid3=Stukov is the only one who can deactivate the Xel'Naga Temples.<n/>If he is killed in battle, he will revive at your primary Hatchery.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZKorhal1=Zerg Drop-Pods will arrive gradually and over a wide area.<n/>Be prepared to divide your forces across a large battlefield.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZKorhal2=During this mission you control both Kerrigan and Dehaka. Use the <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect0"/></c> and <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect1"/></c> keys, or click their icons in the upper-left corner of the screen, to switch between them.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZKorhal3=There are many avenues into the Imperial sector, but they are guarded by the Dominion. Eliminate them and Swarm forces will join the fight.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZLab1=Mission objectives are displayed in the upper-left corner of your screen. While Main Objectives are required, Bonus Objectives are optional and grant additional rewards.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZLab2=Sarah Kerrigan is a powerful hero unit with special abilities. You can select her by pressing <c val="ffff00"><k val="HeroSelect0"/></c> or clicking her icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZLab3=It takes 3 Drones to optimally harvest a single Mineral Field or Vespene Geyser. Having enough harvesters is vital to building a powerful army.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZSpace1=The Hyperion has a diverse set of abilities.<n/>Choose the right weapon for each situation.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZSpace2=Kerrigan is infiltrating the Moros without the assistance of Raynor's Raiders.<n/>The Leviathan will supply her with reinforcements.

Map/LoadingHelp/ZStorySpace=
Map/LoadingHelp/ZStoryZerus=
Map/LoadingHelp/ZZerus1=Drones are weak and are easily killed if they are not defended.<n/>Do your best to protect them while they're out in the open.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZZerus2=Spine and Spore Crawlers can Uproot, move, and then Root in a new location.<n/>Use this to focus your defense where it's needed most.
Map/LoadingHelp/ZZerus3=You can use hotkeys to quickly access Kerrigan's abilities.<n/>Her first three active abilities are always bound to "<c val="ffff00"><k val="K5Kerrigan,PrimalSlash,2,0"/></c>," "<c val="ffff00"><k val="K5Kerrigan,PsiStrike,2,1"/></c>," and "<c val="ffff00"><k val="K5Kerrigan,PrimalHeal,2,2"/></c>."
Map/LoadingHelpAlternate/ZChar1=Not all Zerg units morph from Larvae.<n/>Banelings, for example, are morphed from Zerglings.
Map/LoadingHelpAlternate/ZExpedition1=Most Zerg units can burrow into the ground and hide from enemies.<n/>Use this to set up ambushes or to protect your injured units.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZChar1=Zagara will Deep Tunnel to her base when her life is low.<n/>This will stop her from collecting Eggs for a short period.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZChar2=Placing several Creep Tumors in the same area will cause creep to spread faster.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZChar3=The location of an incoming Nuclear Strike is indicated by a large red targeting circle on the terrain. Be sure to move away if you see one.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionBaneling=Exploding Banelings can hit multiple targets.<n/>Aim for the middle of enemy forces.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionHydralisk=The Hydralisk's evolved forms must burrow before they can attack enemies.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionMutalisk=Stay away from Missile Turrets and Bunkers until you have the means to destroy them.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionRoach=Unlike normal Roaches, the Vile strain is most effective when each Roach attacks a different target.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionSwarmHost=Swarm Hosts can attack enemies from far away.<n/>Use their long range to keep them out of harm's way.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionUltralisk=Ultralisks are more effective in combat if you direct them using attack move commands.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZEvolutionZergling=Don't forget about your Hatcheries. You can always morph more Zerglings if you have enough minerals and supply.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZExpedition1=The Protoss are vulnerable while frozen. Attack during the Flash Freeze and then retreat when it ends.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZExpedition2=Spore Crawlers are specialized anti-air defense structures. Place them in front of Warp Conduits to shoot down Protoss Shuttles.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZExpedition3=The Broodmother does not need minerals or vespene gas to birth units.<n/>You should replace your losses as quickly as possible.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZHybrid1=Infested Terrans are useful to absorb enemy fire. Attack aggressively when the gas runs out and retreat when it comes back on.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZHybrid2=Destroying the Dominion base to the west will stop attacks from that direction, allowing you to focus on your enemies to the east.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZHybrid3=Tough units like Ultralisks can soak up a lot of damage. Use them to protect Stukov from enemies while he deactivates Temples.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZKorhal1=The Dominion will continue to attack Bile Launchers after they finish deploying. Be careful not to leave them unprotected.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZKorhal2=The Psi Destroyer Field will slowly expand toward your base.<n/>You must destroy Power Links quickly to prevent the Swarm from being annihilated.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZKorhal3=Jim Raynor will protect your left flank from attacks, but he'll be overrun if you don't send help when he asks for it.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZLab1=If you order your units to attack a point on the ground, they will attack all enemies they encounter along the way. This is called an attack move.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZLab2=Proper use of Kerrigan's abilities is vital. Use Crushing Grip to stun groups of enemies, and Kinetic Blast to destroy dangerous targets like Siege Tanks.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZLab3=Defend your base with Spine Crawlers and Spore Crawlers. If they become injured, have your Swarm Queens heal them.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZSpace1=The Hyperion automatically repairs itself slowly over time. You can seek out Repair Bots or move near Valerian's Space Station to repair quickly.
Map/LoadingHelpRestart/ZSpace2=Kerrigan can't revive while aboard the Moros, so keep an eye on her life. Use your more resilient troops to protect her.

Map/Summary/ZChar1=Zagara has been defeated, and her brood belongs to the Swarm. Kerrigan's focus now returns to General Warfield and the occupying Dominion forces.
Map/Summary/ZChar2=The way to the fortress is clear. All that remains between Kerrigan and the complete domination of Char is General Warfield himself.
Map/Summary/ZChar3=Char belongs to the Swarm. The Dominion occupying force has been destroyed, and an undeniable message has been delivered to the emperor: the Swarm has returned.
Map/Summary/ZExpedition1=Nafash's brood lives within the Swarm, and the psi-link spires have fallen. The protoss expedition must now resort to a more desperate means of calling for aid.
Map/Summary/ZExpedition2=The Swarm has torn the expedition's shuttles from the sky. Unwilling to give in, the protoss have launched an interstellar ship from the dark side of the frozen moon.
Map/Summary/ZExpedition3=The interstellar ship drifts lifelessly through the stars. The Swarm is safe from the Golden Armada of Shakuras, for now.
Map/Summary/ZHybrid1=The outer platform writhes with creep as the infestation spreads into the facility. Kerrigan gathers the Swarm and prepares to enter Narud's laboratory and face the abominations within.
Map/Summary/ZHybrid2=The hybrid-production facility has been destroyed, and the Swarm floods all levels of Skygeirr Station. Narud, however, has yet to reveal himself...
Map/Summary/ZHybrid3=Narud's corpse lies at the heart of Amon's temple, but the battle has cost Kerrigan dearly. Her Swarm gathers around her as her wounds heal.
Map/Summary/ZKorhal1=The Swarm has broken through Korhal's defenses and driven the Dominion's forces into Augustgrad. Aboard her mighty leviathan, Kerrigan has gathered her generals to discuss the invasion of the Imperial sector.
Map/Summary/ZKorhal2=The psi destroyer is in ruins, and the Swarm has endured. Zagara's troops have pushed the Dominion's forces into the Imperial sector, where the palace and Emperor Arcturus Mengsk await.
Map/Summary/ZKorhal3=Arcturus Mengsk is dead, and the Imperial sector of Augustgrad lies in smoldering ruins. With her thirst for vengeance finally quenched, Kerrigan has gathered the Swarm to scour the stars for any sign of the fallen xel'naga Amon.<n/><n/>Discover the fate of the protoss and the entire galaxy in Legacy of the Void, the final chapter in the StarCraft II trilogy.
Map/Summary/ZLab1=Valerian's tests have proved Kerrigan can command the zerg. Now freed from her cell, Kerrigan discusses the future with Jim Raynor.
Map/Summary/ZLab2=The Dominion has invaded! Despite her best efforts, Kerrigan has been separated from Raynor. She flies to the rendezvous point alone to await his arrival.
Map/Summary/ZLab3=A darkness stirs within Sarah Kerrigan. The carnage has awakened something within her, something forgotten. She reaches out for any sign of Jim Raynor. Any sign at all.
Map/Summary/ZSpace1=Valerian and Horner have freed Colonel Orlan from the mercenary Mira Han. Orlan has already begun hacking into the Dominion network, searching for any trace of the imprisoned Jim Raynor.
Map/Summary/ZSpace2=Jim Raynor is safely aboard the Hyperion and being looked over by the Raiders' medical team. Meanwhile, Kerrigan returns to her leviathan more alone than ever before.
Map/Summary/ZZerus1=The Ancient One has awoken, and now Kerrigan is on the path to claim the power of Zerus… but at what cost?
Map/Summary/ZZerus2=The Primal Queen of Blades is born, and all of Zerus shudders at her power. Infused with the essence of the primal zerg, Kerrigan is poised to take Zerus for the Swarm.
