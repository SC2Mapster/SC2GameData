Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00022=[Surprise 60]Luck[/Surprise] is a concept [Surprise 60]that is[/Surprise][Serious] purely human[/Serious] in origin.
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00023=[Surprise 60]We protoss[/Surprise] see the [Surprise]synchronicity[/Surprise] of events and know there is a [Surprise 60]grander design[/Surprise] behind them.

Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00025=Zeratul believed that the artifact in your possession... the Keystone, he called it... could guide us to the xel'naga.

Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00054=Then Amon has turned them into his slaves... an army. They are dangerous, but they are only the start of the war to come.

Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00076=What happened, Artanis? 
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00077=Amon used the Khala to seize control of the templar. I could feel his rage tearing through me, and I was powerless against it.
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00078=Zeratul found me. It was there that he... he...
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00079=Yes?
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00080=He tried to free me... And he succeeded at the cost of his own life. He fell by my hand.

Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00082=Zeratul came to me with a warning, but I did not act. Because of this... he is now gone, and the stars burn dimmer for his loss.
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00083=Amon's deed or not, I carry a burden, Matriarch. One that cannot be easily lifted. 
Conversation/Convo_Communicator/Line00084=[Happy 70]Right...[/Happy] [Serious 60]so,[/Serious] the [Surprise 60]artifact[/Surprise]... eh, the uh, [Surprise 55]Keystone-thingy's[/Surprise] all yours.

Conversation/Cutscene_Ulnar03KaraxOBSOLETE/Line00007=It held onto these energies as it held onto data. The map. It too was just a form of energy. As is consciousness. As is matter.

Conversation/Mission_Epilogue02/Line00104=[Serious]Don't worry about me.[/Serious] [Happy 70]Holding out against impossible odds is practically my thing.[/Happy]
Conversation/Mission_Epilogue02/Line00105=The Swarm must pull back! Amon's forces are too strong. Protect our queen, terran.
Conversation/Mission_Epilogue02/Line00106=James Raynor, the queen's fate is left to you. If you fail and do not die beside her, know that the Swarm will hunt you down.

Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00002=Such an incredible device, I wonder what further mysteries could hide within.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00003=I advise against physical contact with the Keystone at this time, Hierarch.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00004=The craftsmanship that went into engineering this Keystone is a true work of art. The xel'naga were masters of both form and function.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00005=To think, if the xel'naga could craft a device like this, what else they could have borne!
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00006=The terran engineer, Swann, delivered the Keystone. We had an interesting discussion on the construction of artificial limbs.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00007=Despite their limited understanding of the Keystone, it is fascinating that the terrans managed to wield it as a weapon. I am hesitant to conclude that this was its primary function, or even an intended one.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00008=Strange. The Keystone is extracting energies at an unprecedented rate.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00009=I will monitor the Keystone to ensure that its current behavior does not harm the Spear of Adun.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00010=It appears the Keystone is returning to pre-event levels. You missed quite the performance, Hierarch.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00011=The Keystone has slowed its absorption of Void energies. Is it because of the energies below? Or is the Keystone reaching its limit?
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00012=These readouts cannot be right. Or at least, I hope they are not.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00013=The Keystone is resonating once more. The Void energies on Aiur nearly match those of Ulnar... Whatever Amon is doing below is on a colossal scale.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00014=There has to be a way. There is always a path forward, no matter how difficult it may be to find it.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00015=The Keystone will be ready, Hierarch. Just... not yet.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00017=We will need to defend the Keystone until it reaches full power. It will take some time.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00018=The Keystone has its limits, and Amon's power is beyond them. Even our best laid strategies are but chance before a xel'naga.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00019=It is the best I could do in the time allotted. It will have to be enough.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00020=I pray the terrazine we extracted while orbiting Slayn will prove sufficient to test the Keystone's limits.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00021=Do not worry, Hierarch, the Keystone is empty. It would be unwise to begin new tests with lifeforms present.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00022=The energies of the Void are highly unpredictable. The Keystone appears to act as a focal point, converting the energy of one reality into another.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00023=I'm not certain much more progress can be made without a significant source of Void energy, Hierarch.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00024=My research grows more fruitless by the hour. I am sorry, Hierarch... But progress is slow.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00025=Trying to decipher the Keystone is almost maddening. Without finding at least a single piece of common ground, one could create unique and yet valid results forever.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00026=The Keystone is resonating to Void energies below. We should investigate this further, Hierarch.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00027=What possible source of Void energy is emanating from Slayn? Hybrid? I shudder to think what lurks below.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00028=The terrazine converted from gas to energy with no loss or gain... Incredible.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00029=If the Keystone was constructed to store its origin point within, it would need to be expressed in a unifying language any culture could interpret.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00030=This decay rate is impossible. No constructed material would behave this way... unless...
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00031=Ah, yes. I see... the physical shape is a deception. That would mean it can be realigned.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00032=When exposed to Void energies, the Keystone begins absorbing them immediately, even from a considerable distance... We can use this.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00033=There must be a way to test the limits of the Keystone's absorption capabilities... Where does one acquire Void energy?
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00034=Interesting. I believe the Keystone is incredibly ancient. It may very well be the first thing the xel'naga created upon entering our universe.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00035=Even these results require further testing.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00036=The Keystone is quite dangerous at this moment, Hierarch. I would keep your distance for now.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00037=The material inherently absorbs Void energy and redistributes it. Now if we only had a scalable source of Void energy...
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00038=Curious, this terran research speculates the Keystone would kill any protoss near it. Such a simple "interpretation" of the evidence...
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00039=For each secret I unravel, another lies in wait. The xel'naga think in ways I can scarcely understand. It is unreasonably frustrating.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00040=Experiments are going well, Hierarch. Hopefully, a breakthrough will occur soon.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00041=The Keystone has yet to reach its limit. It continues to consume Void energy with a voracious appetite. It is quite encouraging, actually.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00042=It is fascinating to witness this device fulfilling its intended purpose. For all my knowledge, it's as if I am a youngling watching my master at work once more.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00043=Matriarch, the Keystone is shielded, but I would keep your distance. We have never witnessed an event like this. It is entirely unpredictable.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00044=The Keystone is reacting to an energy source within Ulnar. It's as if the xel'naga are calling it home...
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00045=The construction of Ulnar and the Keystone share remarkable similarities. This is speculation, of course, but they appear to complement each other.
Conversation/Response_Keystone/Line00046=To think, this device's makers--our makers--are so close to us. It is a truly humbling thought.

Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00005=Welcome to the Dominion Future Commander Training Simulation Module.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00006=Here you will learn to use our interface and issue orders to your forces.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00007=Begin by left-clicking on a unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00008=Information about the selected unit is displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00009=Additionally, the commands for this unit are displayed in the bottom right.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00010=Left-click a unit to select it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00011=It is time to issue a command. Right-click the beacon to order the marine to move to it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00012=Well done, recruit.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00013=Right-click the beacon to order the marine to move to it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00014=Next, you will learn the Attack-Move order.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00015=This is another way to instruct the marine to move, but he will automatically attack any enemies along the way.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00016=Give the Attack-Move order now. Press the attack key to enter the targeting mode, then left-click the ground to confirm your target location.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00017=Please ensure you target the ground at the highlighted area with your attack order, commander.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00018=Right-clicking or pressing the Escape key will cancel targeting mode.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00019=Issuing a new order will override the previous one.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00020=That's it, commander. I have noted your ability to follow basic instructions.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00021=Press the attack key to enter targeting mode, then left-click the ground at the highlighted area to confirm your target location.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00022=You may adjust your view of the battlefield any time by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00023=Try adjusting your camera so that it is centered on the highlighted area ahead.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00024=Hostile units detected. I will send you additional reinforcements.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00025=Move your mouse to the top right corner of the screen to center the camera on the highlighted area.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00026=The minimap will reveal an overview of the battlefield. It is located in the bottom left section of the screen.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00027=You can also left-click the minimap to change your view of the battlefield. Left-click the highlighted area on the map now to view your reinforcements.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00028=Please use the minimap to adjust the camera's position.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00029=Very good, commander. Your aptitude scores have exceeded the current average.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00030=Left-click on the minimap to center the camera over the indicated area.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00031=You will need to select all of your marines before engaging the hostile units.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00032=Left-click and hold to drag a box around your units. This will result in their selection.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00033=You can select your forces by holding left-click and dragging the box around them.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00034=The Dominion prizes cooperation. You may order a group of units in the same manner you would order an individual.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00035=Issue an Attack-Move command to your marines by pressing the attack key, then left-clicking the ground to confirm your target location.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00036=Remember to target the ground at the highlighted area to complete your order.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00037=Right-clicking or pressing the Escape key will cancel targeting mode.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00038=Issuing a new order will override the previous one.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00039=I see your proficiency for leadership was not a statistical anomaly.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00040=Receiving transmission. Command simulation terminated.

Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00043=[Happy 90]Welcome to Taurus IV.[/Happy] [Angry 70]Not my favorite planet in the sector...[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00044=[Angry 90]It can get ugly out there.[/Angry] I need you to establish a base and [Angry 90]send out a search party. [/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00045=Your command center's [Angry 90]landing now.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00046=You're gonna need some SCVs to handle your mining and construction.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00047=We're low on stored minerals, so let's get the SCVs gathering them.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00048=[Happy]Look at 'em go.[/Happy] They'll keep mining until you tell them to stop. [Happy]Must think they're getting paid overtime, heh.[/Happy]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00049=Check the top right corner of your screen to see how many minerals you've stockpiled.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00050=Left-click and [Surprise]drag your selection box[/Surprise] over the SCVs. Then, right-click a mineral cluster to get them to mine it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00051=[Angry 60]We're gonna need more SCVs[/Angry] to get all the minerals we need. You can train them up at the Command Center.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00052=[Happy 90]You're getting the hang of this.[/Happy] SCVs take time to get ready, but you can queue up some more while we wait.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00053=We'll need twelve SCVs to mine efficiently here.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00054=I'll even set up an objective for you at the top left of your screen, so you can track your progress. [Happy]Don't bother thanking me.[/Happy]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00056=First, select your command center.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00057=[Happy 70]Nothing's free out here.[/Happy] Everyone on this base costs us a certain amount of supplies.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00058=Up in the top right corner of your screen, you'll see the current supply amount and its limits. Reach the limit, and we can't train anyone else.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00059=[Happy]Good news[/Happy] is that SCVs can set up supply depots to increase our limit.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00060=[Angry 70]Go on[/Angry] and order an SCV to build a supply depot.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00061=[Happy 70]All right, [/Happy]he'll be busy until the depot's finished, but after that, you can assign him a new task.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00063=Looks like that SCV's all done, but [Happy]we don't have break times here![/Happy] [Angry 70]Let's get him back to mining.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00064=That's right.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00065=[Angry 90]No lazing around on my watch.[/Angry] Select that idle SCV, then right-click a mineral cluster to [Angry 90]get him back to work.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00066=Let's finish training these SCVS, huh?
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00067=[Happy]Good.[/Happy] Those are all the SCVs we need.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00068=Seems like we're still short [Angry 80]a few SCVs.[/Angry] Select your command center and click the "Train SCV" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00069=Next thing we're gonna need is a barracks to train our troops for combat.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00070=Select an SCV and order him to start building one.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00072=[Happy]That's a good lookin' barracks, if I say so myself.[/Happy] Let's start training some marines.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00073=We'll need [Angry 60]five of them[/Angry] before we push out. Your objective has been updated so you can keep track.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00074=[Happy]You'll be promoted in no time if you keep this up.[/Happy] Let's get those marines on the move.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00075=Select the barracks and click the "Train Marine" button to get 'em started.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00076=[Angry 80]Time to find those missing scientists.[/Angry] Select your marines and order them to head to the bridge.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00077=[Angry]Hold on, commander.[/Angry] I'm receiving some intel from our scanner sweep.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00078=[Angry 80]It's detecting zerg bio signatures in this area.[/Angry] [Surprise]We're gonna[/Surprise] have to be real careful [Angry]with this one.[/angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00079=Select your marines and order 'em across the bridge. [Angry]Keep your eyes open out there.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00080=Use your Attack-Move command while exploring. Then your marines will be [Angry]on their guard if they come across enemies.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00081=[Angry]Move out![/Angry] We gotta check for survivors.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00082=[Angry]Ah hell, our men are down.[/Angry] I've got some reinforcements for you, but [Angry]go easy on 'em, okay?[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00083=Well, there's our scientists--what's left of them.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00084=I'd better let HQ know about this. [Angry]Hold here and wait for further orders.[/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00085=[Angry 80]There's no time to mess around.[/Angry] Give your marines an Attack-Move order to get 'em to the next beacon.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00086=Ah, a new minion. I am your brood mother, and you will serve me to the death.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00087=First, you will make the terrans suffer for their interference on this planet.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00088=I will join you soon with reinforcements. Prepare this hive cluster for my arrival.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00089=The hatchery is the heart of our hive cluster, and it spreads nourishing creep beneath us.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00090=A new larva is born from the hatchery periodically. You can morph it into more useful forms.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00091=But for now you are low on supply. Morph a larva into an overlord to increase it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00092=Our swarm requires overlords to grow. If you do not have enough of them, you will be unable to morph your larva.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00094=Your hatchery has birthed more larvae. Morph them into drones and we shall grow your hive cluster.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00098=A spawning pool will allow you to add zerglings to your brood. Order a drone to morph into one.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00099=Drones are unable to resume harvesting after they become structures. We will need more drones to account for this.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00101=That spawning pool looks noxious and fetid. Good. Now morph your larvae into zerglings.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00102=Each larva will become two zerglings. Their strength comes from their numbers.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00105=Ah, there is a vespene geyser nearby. Excellent.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00106=First, you must order a drone to morph into an extractor above the geyser.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00107=Once that is finished, other drones will be able to harvest gas from it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00108=Select a drone, click the Basic Mutation button, then click the Mutate into Extractor button. Lastly, left-click on the vespene geyser.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00109=You will require three drones to harvest vespene gas from the extractor efficiently.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00110=Yes... The amount of gas you have gathered is shown in the top right corner.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00111=Select a drone, then right-click the extractor to order it to gather vespene gas.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00112=You are ready to strengthen your brood... A roach warren will allow you to morph stronger creatures.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00113=I see your mind is also... evolving.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00114=Select a drone, click the Basic Mutation button, then the Mutate into Roach Warren button. Left-click on the ground to place the structure.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00115=Your roach warren is ready. You may begin morphing roaches.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00116=Roaches are bred to absorb damage. Their fortitude will help you conquer this world.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00117=To morph a roach, select the hatchery, click the Select Larva button, then click the Morph to Roach button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00118=You are ready to command my brood. Do not disappoint me.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00119=Select your forces and lead them to victory!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00120=Let the terrans tremble before us.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00121=That was not victory. But then, you have only just evolved. I will replenish your brood, but do not fail me again.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00122=Do not make me wait, minion. Attack!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00123=Fight on! Bring their base to ruin.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00124=Your brood has been annihilated. Here are reinforcements... Try using them to impress me.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00125=[Angry 90]This is the 21st Assault Division on Taurus IV. We are under attack by the zerg. Do you read me? Immediate evac requested... We need--[/Angry][Angry 80]AGH![/Angry]
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00126=The zerg have claimed this world, and all on it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00127=Finish them! Destroy their base!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00128=Heed me, warriors. We have intercepted a terran distress signal from Taurus IV. The zerg have invaded the planet.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00129=We shall not let this stand. We must eradicate the enemy at once!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00130=The terran transmission originated at these coordinates...
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00131=It appears their warriors have already been infested by the zerg. We must give them peace in death.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00133=These infested terrans cannot be saved. We must slay them.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00134=Onward, my warriors. We still have much to learn about what transpired here.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00135=We have to go further. I must know how far the zerg infestation has spread...
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00136=It is as I feared. This world is consumed. I shall need the Golden Armada's aid to cleanse it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00137=Forward, my forces. We shall see what lies ahead.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00138=We will soon be outnumbered by the zerg. We must fall back to safety.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00139=Cross the fallen rocks using the Blink ability.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00140=These structures were abandoned long ago. But we can reactivate them, and hold here until the armada arrives.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00141=Our gateways need a pylon to power them. Order a probe to warp in a pylon nearby.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00142=Pylons will power any nearby structures and provide supply for our forces.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00143=Our probes are highly efficient. We can reassign them to other tasks after they have initiated the warp process.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00144=Order a probe to warp in a pylon near the gateways, and their power will be restored.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00145=The gateways are now active. Let us use them to warp in zealots.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00146=Excellent. We now have enough zealots.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00147=We require more zealots to hold this ground. Warp them in from the gateways now.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00148=But we cannot withstand the fight ahead without additional stalkers. We will require a cybernetics core in order to warp them in.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00149=Fine work. Stalkers will help us put an end to those zerg.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00150=We cannot warp in stalkers without a cybernetics core. Order a probe to warp one in now.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00151=Well done. Initiate warp sequences for the stalkers at our gateways.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00152=We have enough stalkers to proceed. But we must still be cautious, brothers.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00153=We still require more stalkers. Warp them in from the gateways.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00154=The zerg approach our nexus point. Warriors, ready your blades!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00155=Your bravery has brought us victory, my warriors. The Golden Armada has arrived!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00156=We are the Swarm: numberless... merciless.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00157=Initiating mass recall.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00158=Weaklings! You retreat in the face of battle.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00159=No. We strike as one.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00160=Your completion of this exercise has placed you in the 90th percentile of all Dominion recruits.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00161=Some of our science officers went out lookin' for [Angry]protoss artifacts[/Angry] last week, and [Happy]those eggheads[/Happy] haven't returned yet.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00162=All of our structures must mutate on creep. Do you not find it welcoming?
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00163=They're everywhere!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00164=We require zealots to hold this ground. Warp them in from the gateways now.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00165=Our stalkers should be able to cross the debris by using the Blink ability.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00166=We must retreat to a secure location.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00167=Zerg! Unleash hell, marines!
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00168=That pylon is too far away from the gateways to power them. Construct a pylon in the marked area.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00169=The hatchery is the heart of our hive cluster.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00170=It automatically spawns new larva over time. We can then morph these larvae into more useful forms.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00171=You are low on supply, and your swarm cannot grow. Morph a larva into an overlord to increase your supply.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00172=Good. Drones harvest resources and mutate into structures according to our needs.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00173=If you are to conquer this planet, you will require an army. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00174=But before you can create one, you will need a spawning pool. Order a drone to mutate into one now.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00175=Yes... As your swarm grows in number, you will need to continue to morph overlords to increase your supply.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00176=Our forces are protected by their shields. They will regenerate quickly unless they take further damage.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00177=Just select an SCV to get started.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00178=Click the "Build Structures" button to bring up the build menu.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00179=Click the "Build Supply Depot" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00180=Left-click the ground to confirm the building site.

Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00182=Click the "Build Structures" button to bring up the build menu.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00183=Click the "Build Barracks" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00184=Left-click the ground where you wanna place it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00185=To evolve an overlord, first select the hatchery, then click the "Select Larva" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00186=Click the "Morph to Overlord" button to begin the mutation.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00187=To morph drones, select the hatchery, then click the "Select Larva" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00188=Click the "Morph into Drone" button to start the mutation process.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00189=You now have two larvae selected. Click the "Morph into Drone" button twice to make both of them into drones.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00190=To make a spawning pool, first select a drone.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00191=Click the "Basic Mutation" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00192=Click the "Mutate into Spawning Pool" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00193=Left-click on the ground to place it.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00194=Select the hatchery, then click the "Select Larva" button. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00195=Click the "Morph to Zergling" button to create zerglings.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00196=You have enough larvae to morph more zerglings. There is no need to delay.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00197=You must select a drone.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00198=Click the "Basic Mutation" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00199=Click the "Mutate into Extractor" button. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00200=Left-click on the vespene geyser to begin creating the extractor.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00201=Select a drone to begin.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00202=Click the "Basic Mutation" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00203=Click the "Mutate into Roach Warren" button. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00204=Left-click on the ground to place the warren.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00205=To morph a roach, select the hatchery, then click the "Select Larva" button.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00206=Click the "Morph to Roach" button. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00207=You have enough larvae to morph more roaches. Do not waste time.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00208=First, you must select a probe. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00209=Left-click the "Warp in Structure" button to open the structures menu.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00210=Click the "Warp in Pylon" button to enter placement mode. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00211=Left-click the ground near your gateways to restore their power.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00212=First, you must select a probe.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00213=Left-click the "Warp in Structure" button to open the structures menu.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00214=Click the "Warp in Cybernetics Core" button to enter placement mode. 
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00215=Left-click the ground to place the core.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00216=That pylon is only in range of one of the gateways. You must construct an additional pylon near the second gateway.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00217=Mutating a drone into a structure is permanent. Remember to morph more drones to account for this loss.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00218=Now I shall instruct you how to morph more advanced minions, but to do so, you will require vespene gas.
Conversation/Tutorial_SC2Core/Line00219=All right, now left-click the "Train SCV" button to create a new SCV.

Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00011=The Golden Armada has devastated the sector, Artanis. I know we cannot engage them directly, but this must not continue.
Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00012=Our scouts are reporting the Dominion is attempting to fight back the Golden Armada. Despite their efforts, multiple systems have fallen.
Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00013=Hierarch, my scouts are tracking the movements of the Golden Armada.
Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00014=It has all come down to this.
Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00015=I have received word from our scouts. It seems Amon's forces are dividing to conquer separate parts of the sector at once.
Conversation/pAmbientGreeting_DTLeader/Line00016=Many of my dark templar have volunteered to act as scouts for us. They will keep us aware of Amon's movements.

Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00188=[Surprise 55]For day by day[/Surprise] I saw [Surprise 40]my people[/Surprise] [Angry 50]losing[/Angry] what they were. [Surprise 40]I saw[/Surprise] our precious [Angry 60]old ways erode.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00190=I am going into the Ulnar temple alone, Matriarch. I do not intend to risk any more lives.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00191=The dawn of a unified protoss requires much. Like the threads of a cloth, we must come together and be stronger because of it.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00193=Yes. We will be changed. And perhaps that is what you fear more than battle. The path ahead is uncharted, Matriarch.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00196=We viewed your practices as barbaric, and you viewed ours as cruel. It is the same with the Tal'darim.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00199=It is true a great battle may loom on the horizon ahead of us, but it's a risk we must take.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00200=[Surprise 45]To think what we'd become[/Surprise] with their culture [Angry 55]influencing us[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]Changing us.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00201=It is a [Angry 75]great risk.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00202=[Surprise 50]They share our blood[/Surprise], but they [Angry 70]are not like us.[/Angry] [Surprise 60]You know in your heart[/Surprise] that may [Angry 40]never change.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00203=[Surprise 60]And how many resided[/Surprise] [Angry 55]on the world below?[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00204=Eight hundred thousand Khalai. A contingent of templar. 
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00207=[Surprise 55]I only hope[/Surprise] their deaths [Angry 50]were swift.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00208=Why was Endion chosen as the world Cybros was to orbit?
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00209=For thousands of years, it has been a research retreat.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00210=Here, protoss scholars secluded themselves from political affairs...
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00211=When it was decided that the Purifiers would be shut down, they became a symbol of achievement, but also, the dangers of it. 
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00212=So they were brought to a research colony?
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00213=Where better than a place where our greatest scientists resided, constantly improving Cybros's stasis field.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00214=[Surprise 50]You will forgive me[/Surprise] if I [Angry 60]do not[/Angry] place [Angry 70]my faith[/Angry] in the words [Angry 50]of an exile.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00215=But you are also protoss. That is the greater affiliation.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00216=That is [Angry 50]not what the Conclave believed[/Angry] when we were [Angry 60]exiled long ago.[/Angry] [Surprise 50]Your kind had Aiur.[/Surprise] [Angry 50]Our culture[/Angry] is all we [Angry 40]ever had.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00217=[Surprise 50]Amon's forces[/Surprise] arrived here [Angry 60]before we did[/Angry]. [Surprise 45]The temple[/Surprise] may already be under [Angry 65]his control.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00218=Zeratul believed the other xel'naga were here, and that they would stand with us against Amon. They could end the war. My people could be free once again.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00219=Then why have the xel'naga not answered us?
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00220=[Surprise 50]You risk your own life[/Surprise] on the [Angry 80]word of a traitor.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00221=He killed your mother, Vorazun. That is true... But he was never a traitor.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00222=I do not wish for death, only to see Zeratul's visions fulfilled.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00223=[Surprise 55]You will return[/Surprise]--that much [Angry 65]I believe.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00224=Nothing was as it seemed. We came to Ulnar to awaken the xel'naga and receive their aid. Instead, Amon nearly killed us...
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00225=I fear Zeratul's prophecy is no longer clear to me.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00226=[Surprise 60]He was closer to the truth than I thought.[/Surprise] The xel'naga [Angry 70]did rest[/Angry] here.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00227=[Surprise 55]Had they lived[/Surprise], [Angry 40]I think they would have[/Angry] given [Surprise 45]us their aid[/Surprise], just as [Angry 55]Zeratul said[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]If nothing else[/Surprise], I will grant [Angry 60]him that.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00228=Matriarch... Your words surprise me.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00229=[Surprise 60]Perhaps your counsel[/Surprise] has proved [Angry 50]influential[/Angry] in [Angry 30]some regards.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00230=Then I will endeavor to give you more of it.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00231=[Surprise 50]I said[/Surprise] [Angry 40]some[/Angry] regards, Hierarch. [Angry 60]Not all.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00232=[Surprise 60]Aiur[/Surprise]... [Surprise 50]Some of my people[/Surprise] are seeing it for the [Angry 40]first time[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]They were born on Shakuras[/Surprise] and have [Angry 50]only heard tales[/Angry] of our homeland.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00233=They will see much more of it, now that the power of the Keystone is within our grasp.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00234=Zeratul spoke truly... it has ushered us unto hope. 
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00235=[Angry 50]Yes[/Angry], [Surprise 60]though not[/Surprise] as we [Angry 40]initially suspected.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00236=Still, his tireless devotion brought us this chance. I will forever honor him for that.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00237=As shall I.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00238=[Surprise 55]In time, they may be[/Surprise]. I [Angry 60]feared losing our old ways[/Angry], [Surprise 50]Artanis[/Surprise], but [Angry 40]as we've worked[/Angry] with the [Surprise 40]Tal'darim and the Purifiers[/Surprise], [Angry 55]I now see[/Angry] that it is [Surprise 55]inevitable.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00239=[Angry 60]Traditions must change[/Angry] as [Surprise 50]we do.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00240=[Surprise 60]A day may come[/Surprise] when we [Angry 40]leave behind[/Angry] the [Surprise 50]Shadow Walk[/Surprise], just as [Angry 50]you have abandoned[/Angry] the Khala [Surprise 55]and the caste system.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00241=That is the price we must pay to become truly one people.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00242=So I have come to believe.
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00243= ...to focus on the task of devising technology that would benefit the empire. The psi-matrix was first conceived here. 
Conversation/pConvo_DTLeader/Line00260=[Surprise 60]Shakuras is gone...[/Surprise] [Surprise 40]It has become one[/Surprise] with the [Angry 50]eternal night[/Angry]. [Angry 40]But the traditions[/Angry] we forged there will [Surprise 45]remain with us[/Surprise] [Angry 60]forever.[/Angry]

[Angry 70]Primitive.[/Angry] They [Surprise 60]communicate[/Surprise] through... [Angry 50]orifices[/Angry]... [Surprise 60]mouths.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00043=Many, including myself, once thought as you do. But I have seen their nobility. In time, you will also.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00070=Their homeworld has always been Aiur. They have never forgotten it, or the sacrifice that delivered them to safety.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00071=You speak of Adun.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00072=[Surprise 50]So sayeth[/Surprise] Judicator Zentheon: "[Surprise 60]Adun[/Surprise] [Angry 65]failed to eradicate[/Angry] the rogue tribes, [Surprise 60]those who[/Surprise] call [Angry 60]themselves the Dark Templar."[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00074=Treason? Adun chose mercy rather than committing genocide. This was a noble act, preserver.

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00240=[Surprise 55]Only one path was ever found[/Surprise] to [Angry 60]end the madness[/Angry] and [Surprise 60]unify our people: the Khala.[/Surprise] The dark ones [Angry 60]rejected its light.[/Angry]

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00292=History's truths are only ever understood looking through the backwards lens, seeing its consequences take root.

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00295=I'm afraid they returned some time ago, Rohana.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00296=Why would any being willingly follow Amon?
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00297=That is unclear. The Tal'darim call themselves the Chosen. What Amon has chosen them for, we do not know.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00298=[Surprise 60]Protoss turned upon protoss... [/Surprise][Angry 70] The Dae'Uhl demands retribution for such offense. They must be destroyed.[/Angry]

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00301=[Surprise 60]What you plan to do[/Surprise] is awaken [Angry 55]monsters[/Angry], Artanis. [Surprise 70]They slaughtered[/Surprise] every [Angry 60]templar on the base of Lantinum.[/Angry]

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00309=I believe in Fenix. I am willing to take the risk.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00310=We thought them fanatical servants of the xel'naga for years, but in truth they had enslaved themselves to Amon.

Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00341=And he uplifted our people... They ruled over us as teachers, as gods.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00342=[Angry 60]He changed us[/Angry], [Surprise 65]manipulated our essence[/Surprise], but [Angry 50]we grew[/Angry] beyond his control. [Angry 60]He and his followers[/Angry] [Surprise 40]fled to[/Surprise] Zerus to [Angry 60]create the zerg.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00343=[Angry 60]The hybrid are the culmination of his efforts.[/Angry] [Angry 80]False xel'naga[/Angry] [Surprise 50]created in his[/Surprise] image. [Angry]They...[/Angry] [Surprise]We must...[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00344=Rohana!
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00345=This is too dangerous. You cannot go on like this.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00346=[Surprise 60]I must, Hierarch.[Surprise] It is [Surprise 60]my duty to know the truth[/Surprise], [Angry 60]to bear it.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]I know now--this[/Surprise] is [Angry 50]my purpose.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00349=Rohana, do you not see why you must sever your nerve cords? I cannot allow you to fall under Amon's sway again.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00352=[Surprise 60]The Khala was created[/Surprise] in [Angry 50]our darkest moment.[/Angry] [Surprise 70]Only its light[/Surprise] was able to [Angry 60]bind our people[/Angry]--[Surprise 75]to give us unity.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00353=We are [Angry 40]born[/Angry] into it, and [Surprise 70]when we die[Surprise], our spirits [Angry 50]become one with it[Angry]. [Surprise 60]It is[/Surprise] [Angry 60]worth fighting for.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00354=And now Amon uses it against us. It sustains his existence. Its time must end.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00355=[Surprise 60]Artanis,[/Surprise] through [Angry 50]the Khala[/Angry], our [Surprise 60]every thought and emotion[/Surprise] are made [Angry 55]as one.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00356=How?
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00357=[Surprise 60]Just as he can[/Surprise] see [Angry 50]into me[/Angry], [Surprise 50]I can see into him.[/Surprise] [Surprise 70]We can use this to our advantage, Hierarch.[/Surprise] [Angry 50]I know it.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00358=It is not worth it.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00359=[Surprise 70]Please[/Surprise], I [Angry 50]only ask[/Angry] for time.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00360=[Surprise 60]Amon's presence[/Surprise] within the [Angry 50]Khala grows stronger.[/Angry] [Surprise 60]He is becoming[/Surprise] [Angry 60]harder to resist.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00361=You risk much for this, Rohana.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00362=[Surprise 60]He believes all suffering[/Surprise], [Angry 60]all conflict[/Angry], [Surprise 50]results from the xel'naga's[/Surprise] [Angry 60]Infinite Cycle. That it must end.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00370=Yes, he has made this clear.
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00371=[Surprise 55]But you see only the surface.[/Surprise] [Angry 50]Underneath[/Angry], a silent [Angry 60]hatred roils within him[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]A prideful resentment[/Surprise] that would see [Angry 70]all worlds burn.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00372=[Surprise 60]The hybrid[/Surprise] are the [Angry 60]true face[/Angry] of Amon. [Surprise 55]He wishes[/Surprise] not only for the [Surprise 60]xel'naga's creations[/Surprise] to be [Angry 50]set aside[/Angry], but for [Angry 60]them to suffer.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00373=Is this what you think of Fenix? A robot whose only purpose is to do your bidding?
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00374=[Surprise 60]As a preserver[/Surprise], I have always [Surprise 50]experienced history[/Surprise] as a [Surprise]living breathing[/Surprise] [Angry 60]now[/Angry]. [Surprise 55]As those who experienced it[Surprise] [Angry 50]in the moment[/Angry] did. 
Conversation/pConvo_Preserver/Line00375=[Surprise 60]Perhaps I should consider[/Surprise] the way [Angry 60]you[/Angry] view it.

Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00002=You speak as if I know this warrior...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00005=It must give you great satisfaction to see Raynor again, to know that he has continued to fight in the face of such adversity.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00006=So this is the homeworld of the Nerazim... A planet shrouded in darkness. Fitting.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00007=You have become a mighty warrior since last we fought together, Artanis.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00013=I pondered the events that brought me here. There is much I should remember... but do not. My body is machine like the Purifiers.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00014=But you are not like them...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00018=You were right all along, Hierarch. I am little more than a clone of your friend Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00022=Then it appears as if you have found purpose, brother.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00024=We have achieved an incredible feat, friend Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00027=I have such tangible memories of Aiur. I can still feel the warm breezes of Aldera. Its hot sunlight filling my every pore.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00029=I have been blessed to truly get to know you, Artanis. To call you friend, not just because of memory, but through experience. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00031=You once called him friend, Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00032=I have no recollection of this alien.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00033=Ah... Your consciousness must have been encoded before Raynor came to aid us on Aiur.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00034=I have noticed. There are gaps in my memory.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00035=Much has changed in the years I was put in stasis. My body is no more. I am as a dragoon.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00036=Yes. Know that you and I once stood shoulder to shoulder with James Raynor in battle...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00037=Then I hope we shall do so again!
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00045=I have watched this Jim Raynor, studied the archives...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00046=There is more to find in those archives. About Raynor... about yourself, if you have the courage to look further.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00047=I understand why I would respect him so. Why I was... his friend.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00048=I am aware that part of my past may be lost forever, but now is not the time to lament.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00049=Certainly not when the glory of battle lies ahead!
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00050=Beautiful, is it not?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00051=Indeed. I never imagined the Firstborn would ever step foot upon it.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00052=As Aiur fell to the zerg, we fled to this world as refugees. The Dark Templar accepted us as equals.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00053=It was here that we first stood against the Swarm as one.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00054=I wish I could have stood by you and shared in such glory.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00055=As do I.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00056=Even these dark templar revere you as if you were Adun himself.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00058=If only Tassadar could have lived to see what you've become...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00059=I often think about him... of how different these events would have been if he were still in command.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00060=You are Hierarch now. Your doubts do not honor you or him. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00075=It is time I faced that.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00076=The ship's data center has uploaded the recent annals and has much of the history you have lost.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00080=What did you find in the archive?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00081=My death. My rebirth as a dragoon. And then, my death at the hands of this Queen of Blades. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00103=The glory of victory is yours, Hierarch.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00104=I would call it vengeance, Fenix. Vengeance demanded by the blood of warriors.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00105=And yet you have delivered a powerful blow to Amon.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00106=You bear the burden of leadership more capably than you let yourself believe. It is an honor to fight at your side.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00107=Hierarch, the Purifiers are impressed with your leadership. They clamor to strike at the heart of Amon.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00108=Friend Fenix, they are impressed equally with yours. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00109=Yes. They have chosen to follow my command. Leadership is new for me, as is everything else. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00110=I had not intended to become Hierarch. I questioned the decision. There had to be someone more worthy. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00111=Do not fall into the same mental traps I did, my friend. The Purifiers follow you for a reason... 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00112=...as the Daelaam now follow me. Self-doubt will only cloud your decision-making.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00130=Do not think what has happened here will spare Alarak from my watchful eye.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00131=I did not expect it to.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00132=If he dares to betray us, or takes any action against you, I promise his blood will coat these corridors.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00133=Good. That is what I am counting on.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00141=...fighting to preserve all that we hold dear.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00142=Since awakening, I have been confused, directionless... uncertain of what I am, how I came to be.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00143=Now things are clear once more. Fate has laid out a purpose only I can accomplish. It is exhilarating.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00144=Yes, you embark upon a task that even Fenix could not achieve.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00145=Yet he would attempt it if he could. I have learned much from Fenix's memories, and through them, I have come to know myself.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00146=I am Fenix, but not. I am my own entity, and I take pride in this. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00148=Fenix... I have been thinking more upon that name. It is the moniker of another.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00149=I do not believe I should use it any longer. I am not he.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00150=Fenix was the bravest warrior I have ever known. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00151=And yet, you have proven to be of equal bravery. He would have been honored that a warrior such as you bore his name. And so am I.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00152=Your words honor me, Hierarch. But one day, I must find my own path and my own name.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00153=I must know the truth of what I am. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00154=What you will uncover may not be desirable.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00155=He faced terrible odds and emerged victorious, slayed enemies the likes of which most cannot even comprehend.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00156=I am not Fenix, yet I hold his memories as if they were my own... I must have time to consider this. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00159=The Praetor Council took me to Aldera as a youngling too. It is there where I ignited my first psi-blade.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00160=Fenix as well... It was the proudest moment of his life. He felt such purpose, such surety of his existence...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00161=I look forward to seeing this place he so loved for the first time. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00162=Those memories you hold, they are of another place. That world is no more.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00163=Then we shall build a better one on top of it!
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00164=Our journey is not yet over, friend Fenix. If we win this day, know that the glory of building a new civilization lies ahead!
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00173=And I will need you to help me do it. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00174=You and I have stood shoulder to shoulder, blades thrumming in the heat of battle countless times. And now you lead the protoss.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00175=I well with pride at the mere thought of it.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00176=I was chosen to represent the Hierarchy by the remaining judicators and the clans of the Nerazim.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00177=I am still honored by their choice. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00178=Tassadar must be proud as well... 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00179=Tassadar is gone, Fenix. He fell, bravely sacrificing for his people. He saved us from annihilation. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00180=What? It... It cannot be... and Aiur? Fallen to the zerg as well?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00181=It has.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00182=How long have I lingered in stasis? Becoming this... dragoon?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00183=Do you know of the Purifier program, Fenix?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00184=Of course. The greatest templar minds replicated. Dangerous machines that had to be shut down. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00186=They were shut down, but we have never ceased the research, and still have tried to find ways to replicate our greatest templar. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00187=Why do you tell me this?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00188=I... I... We are facing a war like none we have seen before. We will need you in the days ahead. Maybe even the Purifiers. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00189=Then my blades are yours, old friend!
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00190=You are a warrior, Fenix, whether you identify yourself as my old friend or not.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00191=Know that I believe in you, and I believe you will help me destroy Amon's armies and save our people! 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00192=It is a task I greatly look forward to! But I no longer wish to be called by the name Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00193=Yet they persist. Tassadar's shadow looms large over my every action.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00194=You must move from it, old friend. For none of us can truly grow while still in the shadow of his mentor.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00195=The Tal'darim speaks truth. I am synthetic, a replication... a lie.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00196=Do not waver because of this knowledge.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00197=I will try, Hierarch. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00198=I know this will work, Hierarch.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00199=I know I can guide the Purifiers through the darkness that lies ahead--help them accept what they are. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00202=You truly have come far from the Executor I saw encoded in my memories.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00203=It is a role I never intended to fill, old friend. It is one I have grown into.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00204=I hope you find the answers you seek, friend Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00205=...to use that ancient technology. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00206=I can convince them that they will not be treated as servants again.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00207=You speak truth, Hierarch. You speak as a leader. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00208=Oh?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00209=I am honored to choose my own name. It will be Talandar.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00210=Talandar... One who bears a strong heart. A fitting name. So it shall be...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00211=Your interactions with this Jim Raynor piqued my curiosity. I have been studying the ship's archives...
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00213=I understand now why you respect him so. If the archives are to be believed, I was... his friend.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00214=I have come to a realization, Hierarch. I am little more than a clone of your friend Fenix.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00216=You have been reading the ship's archive. What did you find?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00217=Fenix... I have been thinking about that name. It is the moniker of another.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00218=Apologies, Hierarch. I have been pondering the events that brought me here. I have discovered there are holes in my memory.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00219=Battles recorded here, in the ship's archives, that I should be able to recall, but cannot.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00220=Records of my defeat at Antioch and being revived as a dragoon. But this body--it is clear to me that I am no dragoon. 
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00221=What is it you have found?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00222=I am willing to face the truth, old friend, however difficult it may be.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00223=There is more to those records, Fenix. But what you uncover may not be desirable.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00224=Then I hope you find the answers you seek.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00225=Fenix, you appear distressed.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00226=Cybros will not be able to resist the zerg for long. We should move quickly if we hope to save the Purifiers.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00227=I do not know... They may harbor rage, resentment for the actions of our forebearers.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00228=And I believe in you to not create one. Your actions determine the future for both the Templar and the Purifiers.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00229=I require your honest counsel, Fenix... Do you believe the Purifiers will join us?
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00233=Without freedom, a people can be controlled, but never united.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00234=This is true... and yet, the Firstborn have ill need of another enemy.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00235=But now is the time to act, Hierarch.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00236=The Daelaam is not the Conclave. We are united in purpose, like never before.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00237=You are right, the way forward may be difficult, but it is necessary. Thank you, my friend.
Conversation/pConvo_ProtossAI/Line00238=And that is why the Purifiers must be allowed to choose their fate for themselves.

Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00029=[Surprise 50]Look here, Hierarch.[/Surprise] [Angry 50]This material[/Angry] [Surprise 50]self-regenerates.[/Surprise] [Surprise 55]It is no wonder[/Surprise] the research [Angry 50]of the terrans[/Angry] [Surprise 50]claimed it[/Surprise] to be from a [Angry 60]recent epoch.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00032=The Xel'Naga Keystone is ready for deployment?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00033=It is our only option. We must believe that there will be enough time to speak reason.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00057=Speak your mind, Phase-smith.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00072=[Surprise 50]It is said[/Surprise] that these experimentations are [Angry 55]no different[/Angry] than the templar [Surprise 55]they are replications of.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00073=They were and are still only machines. Do not give them such credence, Karax. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00074=[Surprise 50]We too[/Surprise] are machines of [Angry 60]a biological nature.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00075=[Surprise 55]I often marvel[/Surprise] at [Angry 55]the architecture[/Angry], [Angry 65]the design[/Angry], the[Surprise 60] careful construction of our form[/Surprise], our machinery.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00076=[Angry 55]The xel'naga forged us[/Angry] as [Surprise 50]we forged the original Purifiers.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00078=[Angry 60]The replication data[/Angry] is the sort [Surprise 50]that allows accurate duplication[/Surprise] of [Angry 55]one's consciousness[/Angry]. [Surprise 60]Fenix's personality may be accurate.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00080=How accurate?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00081=Within the ninety-ninth percentile. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00082=So there is a chance for discrepancy.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00083=Quite a miniscule one.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00084=And in a lifetime, how many choices does that variation impact? Who would you be with such a difference in the decisions you've made?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00085=Keep a watchful eye on Fenix. If he is to help us, I want to know who he is.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00087=I once thought we protoss had reached the pinnacle of attainable knowledge...
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00088=I was a fool. There is far more in the galaxy than exists within protoss understanding, friend Karax. I know this now.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00090=Then this Tal'darim speaks the truth?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00091=[Angry 50]Void energies[/Angry] [Surprise 50]flood from the temple[/Surprise]. [Angry 70]With each passing moment[/Angry],[Surprise 55] the threat grows.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00106=[Surprise 50]My projections[/Surprise][Angry 50] place it at[/Angry]... [Surprise 50]several billion years old,[/Surprise][Surprise 55] if not more.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00107=And have you discovered anything useful?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00108=All discovery is useful, Hierarch. Although little at the moment is pertinent.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00111=[Surprise 50]Aside from[/Surprise] the construction materials, [Angry 70]there is little deviation.[/Angry] [Surprise 60]How is this feat possible?[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00112=There have always been legends of vessels that set out into the cosmos and never returned--of attack forces gone missing.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00113=[Surprise 55]I have heard these stories[/Surprise]--[Angry 60]whispers of angry spirits [/Angry]of our past [Angry 70]that strike when you are most vulnerable.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00114=[Surprise 50]Imagine if all this time[/Surprise] we have been fighting [Angry 55]an unknown war[/Angry] against [Surprise 50]the Tal'darim.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00115=It would explain a great deal.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00116=[Surprise 55]How sad. They are thieves[/Surprise], [Angry 70]never knowing[/Angry] the [Surprise 50]joys of their own invention[/Surprise]. [Angry 80]How despicable.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00122=What have you discovered about the Keystone, Phase-smith?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00123=[Surprise 50]Only that my skills[/Surprise] may be [Angry 60]inadequate to assess it.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00124=Explain.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00125=[Surprise 50]Imagine the terrans[/Surprise] obtained [Angry 70]one of our[/Angry] fabrication matrices. [Surprise 65]Could their scientists ever understand its engineering?[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00126=[Angry 60]The task set before me[/Angry] is of [Surprise 55]a similar scale.[/Surprise] [Angry 70]The xel'naga were beings beyond our understanding. [/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00127=Keep working, Karax. I have faith in you.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00144=Is there any way to pinpoint Artanis?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00145=[Angry 70]No. [/Angry][Surprise 55]The energies[/Surprise] are making us[Angry 80] virtually blind. [/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00165=[Surprise 50]Outlying protocols[/Surprise] can be [Angry 60]off-loaded[/Angry] to unoccupied cores.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00166=What does any of that mean, Karax?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00167=[Surprise 50]Their data web[/Surprise] was designed to [Angry 60]replicate the sense of the Khala.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]They are connected to each other.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00168=Interesting.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00169=[Surprise 55]Yes,[/Surprise] however, it is a [Angry 50]synthetic [/Angry]representation. [Angry 70]There is no emotional wave.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00170=The engineers who built them could not imagine how they could ever be seen as protoss without the light of the Khala...
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00171=If only our ancestors could see us now.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00179=[Surprise 55]Indeed.[/Surprise] However, [Angry 60]the duration[/Angry] of the effect still[Surprise 50] deeply concerns me.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00180=[Angry 50]No matter what happens[/Angry],[Surprise 55] if we die[/Surprise], we all die [Surprise 50]Templar[/Surprise], and I thank you [Surprise 50]for that[/Surprise]--for [Angry 55]your faith[/Angry] [Surprise 55]in me.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00185=[Angry 60]This is entirely different[/Angry] from how the [Surprise 50]origin point information[/Surprise] was stored, [Surprise 55]as if the Keystone[/Surprise] was [Angry 55]reconfigured [/Angry]for a [Surprise 50]second purpose.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00187=[Surprise 50]Yes. [/Surprise][Angry 55]Void energies[/Angry] [Surprise 70]exude [/Surprise]from this place. [Angry 60]I believe[/Angry] this world [Surprise 50]is a conduit between dimensions.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00188=Let us hope that the xel'naga themselves can reveal the truths you're looking for. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00190=[Angry 60]That[/Angry] is just it, [Surprise 50]Hierarch[/Surprise]. [Angry 70]Without the Khala,[/Angry] [Surprise 50]it is as if[/Surprise] I am [Angry 60]blind.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00191=[Surprise 50]I cannot sense your ]feelings,[/Surprise] know the [Angry 60]true depth[/Angry] of your thoughts. [Surprise 60]I cannot[/Surprise] call upon the [Angry 50]surety[/Angry] of other [Surprise 50]phase-smiths.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00192=[Surprise 60]I feel[/Surprise] the isolation [Serious]as well[/Serious],[Surprise 60] as though[/Surprise] [Serious 80]thrashing[/Serious][Surprise 60] within[/Surprise] the vacuum of space... but [Serious 60]you are not alone, brother. [/Serious]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00193=[Surprise 50]To think[/Surprise]... the [Angry 60]dark templar have endured this existence[/Angry][Surprise 50] all this time.[/Surprise] [Angry 80]The days ahead will not be easy.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00194=[Surprise 60]We may[/Surprise] not have[Serious 60] the Khala[/Serious] to rely on, Karax. [Serious 60]But we[/Serious] still stand[Serious 60] as one[/Serious]. [Surprise 60]We will[/Surprise] endure. [Serious 60]There is no other option.[/Serious]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00195=[Surprise 60]I've been trying[/Surprise] to isolate the [Angry 70]major population centers[/Angry] in [Surprise 60]need of[/Surprise] [Angry 50]evacuation.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00196=There must be Nerazim phase-smiths you know among them? Those who stayed behind?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00197=I am not seeing any protoss life signs from within the engineering bays, Hierarch.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00198=[Surprise 60]Or perhaps they fought their way to safety.[/Surprise] The [Angry 55] Dark Templar[/Angry] do not [Surprise 50]follow our caste system[/Surprise]. Some of [Angry 55]their phase-smiths[/Angry] [Surprise 60]are trained warriors--skilled as any of ours.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00199=That does give them an advantage I had not realized. But then, our people are very different.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00200=Vorazun's ways are different than ours, Karax. But she is ever honorable. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00202=[Surprise 50]Once again[/Surprise], I [Angry 60]bow to your wisdom, Hierarch[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]I will doubt no longer.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00216=[Angry 70]Yes[/Angry], [Surprise 50]guide us... It is a code wanting to be cracked![/Surprise] [Angry 70]The Keystone[/Angry] [Surprise 60]seems to be able[/Surprise][Surprise 60] to manipulate energies[/Surprise], [Surprise 60]but that may not[/Surprise] be its[Angry 70] sole purpose.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00217=[Surprise 60]I believe[/Surprise] it stores [Angry 60]its origin point[/Angry] [Surprise 50]within. [/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00218=Zeratul's vision said that this Keystone can guide us unto hope. What do you think it means?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00219=Its origin point?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00220=[Angry 60]Yes.[/Angry] [Surprise 50]I promise you,[/Surprise][Angry 60] I will find out how this will lead us to[/Angry][Surprise 55] the xel'naga. [/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00221=Redouble your efforts, Karax! There is little time. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00222=[Angry 60]How Zeratul[/Angry] foresaw [Surprise 50]the Keystone[/Surprise] would lead us here[Surprise 55] is uncanny[/Surprise]. It is [Angry 60]now clear[/Angry] that it was [Surprise 50]this device's primary purpose.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00223=Zeratul was in touch with an expression of reality beyond my understanding.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00225=[Surprise 60]Since we arrived[/Surprise] here, [Angry 60]the Keystone has reacted[/Angry] strangely.[Surprise 55] It is as if it is[/Surprise] attuned to[Angry 55] the energies below.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00226=Energies below?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00227=[Surprise 60]Matriarch, the Keystone has begun absorbing Void energies[/Surprise] at an [Angry 70]unprecedented rate. [/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00228=[Angry 60]I do not trust him,[/Angry] but [Surprise 60]all data points to the scenario he describes.[/Surprise] [Angry 70]A gateway to the Void has been opened.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00236=The deeds of a templar suit you, Karax.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00237=[Surprise 55]For the entirety of my life[/Surprise], I have given myself [Surprise 50]to the art of creation[/Surprise]. [Angry 70]My war[/Angry] has been one of [Surprise 55]design[/Surprise].
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00238=[Surprise 55]A battle against[/Surprise] obstacles [Angry 60]that hinder optimization[/Angry].[Surprise 55] I am a phase-smith.[/Surprise] It will always be [Angry 55]my first calling.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00239=[Angry 70]But,[/Angry] [Surprise 50]as times change[/Surprise], those who were not born [Angry 60]true templar[/Angry] [Surprise 60]can become so through their deeds.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00240=Then ready yourself, templar. You will be needed.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00242=If she believes that destroying Shakuras will protect her people from the Dark God, I must respect that. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00246=[Angry 60]I am...[/Angry][Angry 80] alone.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00252=[Surprise 60]Is not Vorazun's plan[/Surprise] to[Angry 60] destroy Shakuras[/Angry] [Surprise 50]conceding defeat?[/Surprise] [Surprise 70]How is there honor in it?[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00253=And the Keystone?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00254=[Surprise 50]Acts as if[/Surprise] siphoning these energies.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00256=[Surprise 50]We must[/Surprise] put [Angry 60]our faith[/Angry] in this [Angry 50]Tal'darim[/Angry]. [Angry 70]It pains me to do so.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00257=[Angry 60]The Purifier weaponry[/Angry] that has been researched here [Surprise 55]could prove[/Surprise] to be a [Angry 50]valuable addition[/Angry] [Surprise 50]to our arsenal.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00258=That is what I am hoping... Is there any merit to Rohana's fears?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00259=[Angry 60]The Khalai on Glacius[/Angry] have [Angry 60]prototyped [/Angry]the technology [Surprise 55]with successful results.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00262=[Surprise 70]A byproduct[/Surprise] of [Angry 55]quantum predictive analytics.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00265=[Angry 60]The zerg pose quite a problem[/Angry]. [Surprise 55]Disrupting the stasis grid[/Surprise] was [Angry 80]never going to be easy...[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00266=...[Surprise 55]and it certainly[/Surprise] will be [Angry 80]less so with Amon's brood attacking us. [/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00267=We will hold them off long enough for your work, Karax. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00268=[Surprise 50]Once the grid is down[/Surprise], [Angry 70]we have to act swiftly[/Angry] and bring Cybros online [Angry 80]or flee orbit[/Angry]. [Surprise 55]The might of the brood[/Surprise] below is [Angry 55]too great.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00269=Leave the defense to me.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00271=Your plan worked, Karax, the stasis grid is down. We must act now!
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00272=And the Purifiers?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00273=[Surprise  50]They have lain dormant[/Surprise] for millennia. [Angry 70]They may still[/Angry] harbor anger[Surprise 50] towards us.[/Surprise] [Angry 80]If they turn on us[/Angry], [Surprise 50]we will have to fight.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00274=We failed them before, not understanding what it was we had birthed. These personalities may be replications, but they are alive. 
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00278=[Surprise 55]After spending so much[/Surprise] time with Fenix, [Angry 55]I share your belief.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00280=[Surprise 50]The scientists[/Surprise] sealed away Cybros [Angry 60]with a device called[/Angry] the Megalith. [Surprise 70]It is the key[/Surprise] to [Angry 55]disabling the station's[/Angry] stasis lock.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00284=Karax, the stasis grid is down. We must act now!
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00285=[Angry 70]Reacting.[/Angry] [Surprise 50]To Void energies[/Surprise] upon the [Angry 55]planet's surface, most likely[/Angry]. [Surprise 55]I've seen this before on Ulnar.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00286=Karax, the Keystone... It's--
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00287=The Tal'darim call it the Breath of Creation. They believe imbibing it allows them to speak directly to Amon.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00288=[Angry 80]A farfetched claim[/Angry], [Surprise 65]yet I cannot deny[/Surprise] its plausibility. [Surprise 60]The substance's[/Surprise] properties[Angry 60] appear to be[/Angry] foreign[Surprise 60] to our universe.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00289=This [Angry 70]terrazine [/Angry]must be [Surprise 50]directly linked to the Void.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00290=[Surprise 50]Our coming here[/Surprise] may be[Angry 70] a blessing to us.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00291=Perhaps this is why it is so holy to them... They seek out planets rich in terrazine and turn them into temples to their god.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00292=Perhaps fate has not abandoned us completely. We must have faith.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00293=[Angry 60]If the Keystone reacts[/Angry] to terrazine [Surprise 60]like it does with Void energy, I may be[/Surprise] able[Angry 70] to use it to stress the artifact[/Angry]... [Surprise 60]determine its limits.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00294=I prefer results, Hierarch.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00296=[Surprise 50]The Keystone is reacting to Void energies on the surface of Aiur! [/Surprise][Angry 60]But this scale...[/Angry] [Surprise 55]it can only be...[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00297=Amon. How long until the Keystone is ready?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00298=[Angry 60]I do not know.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]It has only been[/Surprise] used like this [Angry 80]once before.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00299=[Surprise 50]The Keystone[/Surprise] shows [Angry 70]clear evidence[/Angry] of tampering. [Surprise 55]Likely [/Surprise]by this [Angry 70]Narud creature[/Angry] mentioned in the[Surprise 60] terran engineer Swann's[/Surprise] report.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00300=[Surprise 50]It was adapted to drain[/Surprise] the [Angry 70]Void energies[/Angry] within Kerrigan and [Angry 60]store them[/Angry] until they could be [Surprise 50]redistributed [/Surprise]to[Angry 80] revive Amon.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00301=[Surprise 50]The foundation [/Surprise][Angry 50]is there[/Angry]... [Surprise 55]but it was never [/Surprise]intended to house the[Angry 80] full energies [/Angry]of a xel'naga.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00302=You will find a way, Karax. If there is one thing I have learned, you will not rest until you have found your result.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00303=I have faith in that.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00304=[Surprise 55]Thank you[/Surprise], Hierarch, [Angry 70]but this will prove difficult.[/Angry] [Surprise 50]The Keystone[/Surprise] was intended to be a vessel, [Angry 70]not a prison.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00305=[Surprise 55]Hierarch[/Surprise], [Angry 70]it is done.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00306=It has been my [Surprise 55]eternal honor to serve you[/Surprise], [Angry 60]Hierarch.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00307=[Angry 70]The zerg signatures far outnumber those of the protoss,[/Angry] but [Surprise 60]most of the survivors[/Surprise] seem to[Angry 50] have gathered[/Angry] [Surprise 50]within Talematros.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00308=Then they have met their fate.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00309=[Surprise 50]Of course, Hierarch.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00310=[Surprise 50]Ah,[/Surprise] you must be referring to[Surprise 65] these mechanical arms![/Surprise] I [Angry 50]constructed them[/Angry] to [Surprise 60]improve my efficiency[/Surprise] while running the [Surprise 50]Solar Core.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00311=You look different, Phase-smith.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00312=[Surprise 50]So far[/Surprise] they have been [Surprise 50]quite helpful![/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00317=Does the Spear of Adun bring you no joy?
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00318=Karax, even without the Khala's light, I can sense your sadness, your pain.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00319=[Surprise 55]If we can bring Cybros online[/Surprise], [Angry 60]the battlestation[/Angry] [Surprise70]should begin[/Surprise] to defend itself.
Conversation/pConvo_Smith/Line00320=[Surprise 50]Amon is powerful[/Surprise] in measures[Angry 60] that eclipse[Angry 80] even[/Angry] the Queen of Blades[/Angry]. [Surprise 50]There is no room for uncertainty.[/Surprise]

Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00054=[Surprise 60]To understand Rak'Shir[/Surprise], [Angry 50]you must first understand[/Angry] [Surprise 70]the sacred Chain of Ascension[/Surprise] that [Surprise 70]ultimately links[/Surprise] [Angry 80]to Amon.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00055=[Angry 60]Each of us is shackled to his will[/Angry] [Surprise 55]and to the will[/Surprise] of he who is in [Angry 60]the link above.[/Angry] [Surprise 75]And yet[/Surprise], there is a [Angry 80]way to ascend.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00057=[Surprise 60]By blade[/Surprise] [Angry 50]and blood[/Angry], [Surprise 60]any Tal'darim[/Surprise] can [Angry 50]usurp the position[/Angry] of [Surprise 60]the one[/Surprise] above [Angry 60]his station.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00058=[Surprise 60]It is through this ritual[/Surprise] that [Angry 70]Amon's Ascendants[/Angry] are assured to be [Angry 50]the most capable to carry out his will.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00059=Then Ma'lash is the most powerful of your people?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00060=[Surprise 50]He is[/Surprise] considered [Angry 60]so[/Angry]... but he has [Surprise 50]yet[/Surprise] to [Angry 60]face me.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00061=Ma'lash has proven himself to be a dangerous leader. 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00062=[Surprise 60]Indeed.[/Surprise] That's why [Angry 55]my victory[/Angry] shall be the [Surprise 60]sweetest of ecstasy.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00064=[Surprise 60]Countless.[/Surprise] He [Angry 70]ascended the chain with brutal wrath[/Angry], [Surprise 70]plowing[/Surprise] through [Angry 60]all who opposed him.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00065=[Surprise 65]It's as if he were blessed[/Surprise] by [Angry 80]the Dark God.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]They called[/Surprise] him [Angry 80]the Blade of Amon.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00066=And still he was challenged?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00067=[Surprise 60]It is our way.[/Surprise] He [Angry 70]defeated[/Angry] each with [Angry 85]lingering cruelty.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00068=[Surprise 60]Ma'lash revels[/Surprise] in bringing [Angry 50]his challengers[/Angry] to the [Surprise 60]edge of death[/Surprise] and [Angry 75]tormenting them for a time after.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00069=That does not comfort me, Alarak.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00070=[Surprise 60]Comfort [/Surprise][Angry 80]is a myth[/Angry] given[Surprise 50] to younglings[/Surprise] until [Angry 60]they are ready[/Angry] for [Surprise 60]the trials[/Surprise] [Angry 40]and pain[/Angry] that is [Angry 60]true existence...[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00071=[Angry 80]Leave me.[/Angry] It is [Serious 50]time[/Serious] to [Angry 60]make preparations.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00072=Have the Tal'darim accepted the truth of Amon's betrayal?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00073=[Surprise 65]Some have[/Surprise], others [Angry 70]dare not question my commands.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00074=None wish to declare Rak'Shir upon you?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00075=[Angry 75]Let them![/Angry] [Surprise 60]No one[/Surprise] [Angry 60]can stand in the way of my vengeance![/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00076=[Surprise 60]This grows[/Surprise][Angry 50] tiring. We have done what we came to do.[/Angry] [Angry 80]Set course for Aiur[/Angry], and [Surprise 50]let us[/Surprise] bring this war [Angry 70]to Amon![/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00077=Do not dare give me orders, Alarak. We will return to Aiur only when I believe the time is right!
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00078=[Surprise 65]Let's hope that time[/Surprise] comes [Angry 55]soon.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00085=Idealism? They are the replications of our greatest champions. 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00086=We seek to free your people from Ma'lash. And yet you desire to enslave mine?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00088=[Surprise 55]I care not for freedom[/Surprise], [Angry 60]it softens a people.[/Angry] [Surprise 60]I will dethrone Ma'lash[/Surprise] and [Angry 75]save my kind from oblivion[/Angry], [Surprise 70]but they will not be "free."[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00089=[Angry 70]They will serve me[/Angry]. Freedom is a [Angry 65]delusion[/Angry] granted [Surprise 60]to the weak[/Surprise] [Angry 80]by the strong.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00090=You speak as Amon does. For the sake of your life, that will change.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00091=[Angry 50]Instill[/Angry] the [Surprise 60]Fenix-machine[/Surprise] as the [Angry 50]new executor of the Purifiers[/Angry], and [Surprise 60]use them[/Surprise] as the [Angry 75]tools of destruction[/Angry] they were [Surprise 50]built to be.[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00092=Only [Angry 80]to deliver them to mine[/Angry]. [Surprise 65]I could not[/Surprise] allow my people to be [Angry 60]guided by Amon's lies[/Angry] [Surprise 50]any further[/Surprise], [Angry 75]but make no mistake...[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00093=[Angry 80]They are not "free."[/Angry] Freedom is a [Surprise 65]delusion[/Surprise] granted to [Surprise 70]the weak[/Surprise] [Angry 80]by the strong.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00094=[Surprise 65]Are we finished wasting time?[/Surprise] Or are there [Angry 65]more pointless errands[/Angry] [Surprise 55]to attend to[/Surprise] before we [Angry 70]strike at Amon?[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00095=The Purifiers will be a useful addition to our forces. I would hardly call this an errand.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00096=[Surprise 70]Yes. But as we already discussed,[/Surprise][Angry 60] you chose[/Angry] to give them freedom, [Surprise 70]hoping[/Surprise] that they will [Angry 80]do as you command.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00097=Do not presume to lecture me about my decisions, Tal'darim.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00098=But I so enjoy our exchanges.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00099=Join me then. Together we can defeat him.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00100=[Angry 60]I cannot tether my fate[/Angry] to yours. [Angry]Hatred does not burn within you as it does in me.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00101=[Angry 70]Our focus[/Angry] should be on [Surprise 60]Amon's destruction[/Surprise] [Angry 60]alone.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00102=By destroying Amon's body, then liberating my people from the Khala...
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00103=He will be thrust back into the Void. It is a victory we can achieve. 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00104=[Surprise 65]It is a folly[/Surprise], and a [Angry 60]risk we do not need to incur.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]We should eradicate[/Surprise] the protoss. [Angry 80]Burn the entire world and all on it.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00105=No, Alarak. If we may save my people, it will be done. Do not defy me on this. 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00106=[Surprise 65]Of course, I only[/Surprise] counsel [Surprise 55]wisdom.[/Surprise] If [Angry 50]you do not wish[/Angry] to hear it, [Surprise 65]I will say no more.[/Surprise] 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00107=They have fought nobly, Alarak. I am honored that they stand with me.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00108=[Surprise 70]They admire your conviction[/Surprise] [Angry 60]and brutality.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00109=And if we are victorious this day, will they continue to stand with me?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00110=[Angry 65]If I will it[/Angry]... [Surprise 70]But now[/Surprise] is not the time [Angry 50]to muse[/Angry] upon future things. [Angry 90]Not when my vengeance awaits![/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00119=Then this is something [Surprise 75]I hope to witness. [/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00139=Has he defeated many in this rite?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00140=[Surprise 55]I assume your plan[/Surprise ] is [Angry 70]to bind[/Angry] these robotic warriors [Surprise 50]to your will?[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00141=They will be allowed their freedom, much like Fenix. Making slaves of them is what led to their revolt before. 
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00142=Was it so different when we gave your people freedom by breaking them away from Malash's grip?
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00143=[Happy 80]Such hubris.[/Happy] [Surprise 60]To think that they could control[/Surprise] what [Angry 60]they did not understand.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00145=Perhaps we acted too rashly with Moebius Corps. There may have been a different way.
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00146=[Surprise 70]Oh, it's always hubris[/Surprise] with the terrans. [Angry 75]Get too close to a black hole[/Angry], ]and it will [Angry 90]crush you.[/Angry]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00147=[Surprise 65]Oh, Templar... Is there ever a moment[/Surprise] when [Angry 50]your people[/Angry] [Surprise 55]do not doubt themselves?[/Surprise]
Conversation/pConvo_TaldarimHero/Line00148=[Angry 70]No, Artanis[/Angry], [Surprise 60]extermination[/Surprise] was [Angry 90]the only course.[/Angry] [Surprise 60]The hybrid[/Surprise] leave [Angry 70]nothing to save.[/Angry]

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Comment00002=Aiur. Protoss nexus point. The sights and sounds of war linger in the background. Protoss dominate their homeworld, but it is turning out to be a bloody fight.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Comment00003=Artanis searches the sky--sees the battle raging beyond.

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Group00001=Aiur01 debrief
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00018=It seems the end war you warned of has begun. Tell me, old friend, what is it you have learned?
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00019=I have witnessed the end of all things...
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00021=Yet, you spoke of a way to stand against him.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00022=This vision was a benevolent one, as if an ancient voice called out from beyond. "The Keystone shall usher you unto hope..."
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00023=Keystone?
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00024=I saw a burst of light revealing the Xel'Naga Artifact on the terran world of Korhal. It is the Keystone of this vision. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00025=The prophecies speak of xel'naga standing against Amon in the end times. I believe this Keystone will guide us to them. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00030=You will go to James Raynor on Korhal and receive this Keystone. I will marshal our forces for the war ahead. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00032=Horrific legions of hybrid razing world upon world. In the darkness, lording over them, a shadowy form... Amon.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00035=When you return, the Templar will be ready.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00039=En taro Tassadar, old friend.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00040=En taro Artanis, brother. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00041=There are times I am uncertain whether I was truly ready for such weight. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00042=I have always trusted you, Zeratul. But the burdens of leadership demanded much of me. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur01Post/Line00043=Your doubt is unfounded, young Artanis. You must embrace what you have become if you are to be the leader we now need. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00001=EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00002=CLOSE ON - A DARK TEMPLAR and a terrified Karax stand their ground against Amon's zerg. They've been fighting a long time. Zerglings encircle him. This is bad news bears - they close in for the kill. A hydralisk charges the dark templar. He tries to defend bravely....
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00004=Artanis gets close... blade still out. Karax gets the gist. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00006=Relieved, Artanis lowers his blade.

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00010=Print out - Much later... 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00011=From behind, a PSI-BLADE rips through the hydra's body. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00012=In a flurry of quick shots, Artanis and the zealots turn into mega warriors and slice and dice their way through the zerg. Ultimately, Artanis delivers the final blow. We look at him, hunched over the corpse. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00013=As he turns, he's covered in ichor, his psi-blade up. It's a tense beat as he looks at Karax menacingly. Karax is terrified. Artanis RAISES HIS BLADE. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00014=Artanis prepares to cut Karax's cords. Karax raises his hand. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00015=Karax presents his nerve cords. Artanis lowers his blades. As do the zealots behind him.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00016=REVEAL - ARTANIS, fury written across his face! ZEALOTS are behind him (their nerve cords severed already). 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Comment00017=But is cut down.... leaving Karax alone. Things get tense. He's not a warrior. He's as good as gone. They close in... when...

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Line00014=Artanis, praise the gods!

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Line00016=The Spear of Adun. I... I am honored to have the opportunity. This is fortune we cannot ignore. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur02Post/Line00017=It was done by the dark templar. I am free of the Khala's corruption!

Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00003=Rohana has used her connection to the Khala to reveal Amon's plan. He forges a hybrid body to indwell, and exists within it and the Khala.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00004=But he remains vulnerable until this form is complete. He must call upon the Golden Armada for defense.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00005=There is still a way to prevent them from warping to Aiur--by dismantling the warp network's power structures. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00007=Once he only has the templar to inhabit, we unleash the Keystone, removing Amon from the Khala.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00009=It will not contain him for long.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00010=No. But long enough for our people to sever their connection to the Khala and thrust him back into the Void. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00013=This optimism is dangerous. We could destroy them all from orbit and not waste such time. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00014=How dare you suggest the destruction of our people!
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00017=I will not accept that, Alarak. What we face is a true horror, but we must endure it.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00019=Ready yourselves. The final confrontation is upon us, and we will meet it head on.
Conversation/pCutscene_Aiur04Before/Line00020=That would grant us the time we need to destroy Amon's hybrid form. Clever.

Conversation/pCutscene_PreserverIntro/Line00029=From this chamber, you will be able to make all military allocations.

Conversation/pCutscene_PreserverIntro/Line00042=I assure you, I will stave off this evil, and serve you better by doing so.
Conversation/pCutscene_PreserverIntro/Line00045=Your memories are indeed of use, Rohana. But make no mistake--if you fall to this corruption, I will not hesitate to destroy you.
Conversation/pCutscene_PreserverIntro/Line00047=It is understood. I am prepared for the Firstborn's darkest hour. Come, let me show you what may be done here.

Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00009=Why are you here, Fenix?
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00010=It is the last recollection from his memory-web. The great templar were still encoded by order of the Conclave.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00011=I was given a directive by Aldaris himself to come to Glacius and serve the Templar. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00013=His construction is highly advanced. An adanium shell composed of a trillic compression mesh.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00015=Enough! I have fought far too long for the will of the Conclave to be examined like some specimen! I am templar.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00017=And I am reunited with the dearest of friends... Is this not a glorious day?
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00018=You are right, of course... Karax, these tests are no longer needed. Fenix, welcome aboard the Spear of Adun. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00019=You wished to see me, Phase-smith?

Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00021=It was his cloned personality that was used for the Purifier prototype. 
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00022=Do you know about the experimentation done on Glacius? Why Aldaris gave you this order?
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00023=I am a warrior, old friend. You know this as well as any. It is not my place to question the order of a judicator.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier01Post/Line00025=Given your friendship with the source personality... I thought... Well...

Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00038=You are no different than the Conclave. Once again you try to control us.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00039=No. I wish to make amends for our past failures... I have fought battles alongside one of you--Fenix--the one you are linked with.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00040=The Conclave feared your kind, but they are no more. I know you are true templar. I have seen it. I ask that we stand as one, or none of us shall stand at all.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00044=I will counsel with the others.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00045=If we are to follow, we would ask the entity Fenix to speak for us. There is much about this time we do not yet understand.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00047=But as long as you hold to your word, Hierarch, the Purifiers shall join the Firstborn.
Conversation/pCutscene_Purifier03Post/Line00048=You have shown us that the Purifiers are a mighty force that could turn the tide of this war.

Conversation/pCutscene_PurifierArc2Arrival/Line00025=History has shown the Purifiers cannot be controlled, Artanis.
Conversation/pCutscene_PurifierArc2Arrival/Line00026=They do not have to be. These personalities, like I, will have free will.

Conversation/pCutscene_PurifierArc2Arrival/Line00039=I have seen through Fenix that these warriors may be valuable to us. 
Conversation/pCutscene_PurifierArc2Arrival/Line00040=Perhaps the Conclave misunderstood them, treating them as simple robots and not proud templar. It tried to control them. 
Conversation/pCutscene_PurifierArc2Arrival/Line00041=And they rebelled! Attacking their creators.

Conversation/pCutscene_Shakuras02Before/Line00015=You mean to bleed him.
Conversation/pCutscene_Shakuras02Before/Line00016=We will lure as many of Amon's hybrid and zerg through the gateway as we can.
Conversation/pCutscene_Shakuras02Before/Line00017=Bold. But we can't risk the forces it would require to do such a thing.

Conversation/pCutscene_Taldarim02Before/Line00014=Slaying Ma'lash's guardians fulfilled more than one purpose. Once the Highlord lies dead at my feet, none will challenge my rule.

Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00186=I... I see now. The xel'naga were the first, born within the Void.

Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00190=It was here, from Ulnar, that the xel'naga began to seed the universe with life.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00191=They created us, just as they gave life to a numberless assembly of races in other universes.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00192=Every time, they observe and identify the potential of their offspring... never interfering.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00193=The Infinite Cycle will always be the same. Two races are destined to emerge... one pure of essence, an indomitable spirit capable of great change...
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00194=Ahead of us... within the Chamber of Ascension, the xel'naga have slumbered as civilizations grew, fell, and formed again.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00195=They will awaken when the two destined races arrive.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00196=Then the elders among them will give their lives to bestow their essence...
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00198=...and one pure of form--a being capable of vast psionic potential, able to house the essence of a xel'naga.
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00199=...and pure of form and pure of essence will be reborn as xel'naga, shepherds of the Infinite Cycle. 
Conversation/pMission_Ulnar02/Line00200=There, it gathers power. It should be active shortly.

Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00019=I have faith in Karax. Through him, I see that Templar are defined by their deeds, not their caste.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00021=I will make the Tal'darim our allies, not Amon's.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00022=If all of Alarak's people are as grim as he is, this will be quite an... interesting alliance.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00023=I hope no one gets into the terrazine while we're on Slayn. It is such a difficult habit to break.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00024=Aiur... this is not the first time I have fought for you, but it may be the last.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00025=Rohana now sees that her destiny lies in the future, not in the past.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00026=Zeratul believed that I would become a great leader... that the protoss would place their faith in me. Now I will see if he was right.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00027=The way I have chosen is not easy... but it is right.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00028=The protoss are more than Amon's creations. We will embrace the future on our own terms.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00029=Zeratul... Tassadar... My memories of you give me strength.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00030=The hour has come. This is my final test.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00031=May I honor those who came before me.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00032=The protoss are one.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00033=We must stand together if we are to endure.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00034=This victory belongs to Karax.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00035=Our enemies shall fall... one by one.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00036=These advancements have proved their worth. We should have integrated the Purifiers long ago instead of imprisoning them.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00037=We have come far from a race on the brink of extinction... But it is not over yet.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00040=A Tal'darim on our ship... War makes for strange alliances.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00041=Zeratul... What did it all mean?
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00042=I will do everything in my power to survive this war.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00043=Hold fast, my people... I will come for you as soon as I can.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00044=The terrans have been devastated by this attack, but with time, they may rebuild.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00045=Raynor and I share the bond of a common loss--Zeratul. 
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00046=If only I had heeded Zeratul's warning...
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00047=We lost the Khala, and now Shakuras. Yet we still live--and that is no small gift.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00048=Amon has lost Moebius Corps and the allegiance of the Tal'darim.
Conversation/pResponse_Artanis/Line00049=I hope this new technology proves as valuable as it was rumored to be.

Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00002=My people stand with you.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00003=Our colonies must remain secret.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00004=Shakuras is lost, but we will never forget what we learned there.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00005=This terran friend of yours... He knew my mother, did he not?
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00006=Amon will not rest until every living thing is under his dominion.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00007=Everywhere we journey--destruction and death. This is the future for all if we do not intervene.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00008=The rulings of the Conclave mean nothing to the Nerazim. We must discard the past divisions to pursue the future.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00009=What would the Conclave think of dark templar weaponry? Surely they would have banned it too.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00010=Every course of action we can take will come at a price.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00011=If they are anything like Fenix, the Purifiers have potential.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00012=We received a report from one of our colony worlds. Amon's forces are destroying their neighboring planets... They barely escaped in time. 
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00013=Endion... It is hard to imagine what it must have looked like before the zerg invaded.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00017=Whatever shall we do with this Alarak? He is quite... unpleasant.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00018=Many of the Tal'darim still hate us. I must keep my people safe.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00019=Of all the planets in the galaxy, they chose Slayn for their homeworld?
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00020=The dark templar have saved their Aiur kin before, and we shall do so again!
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00021=There is great wisdom in you, Artanis, and it has only grown.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00022=All of our colony worlds have reported in safe.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00023=A miracle has brought us here.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00024=My mother told me many stories of the xel'naga...
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00025=The Keystone revealed this place to us... Perhaps Zeratul knew something of value after all.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00026=The protoss have suffered too much.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00027=If this is to be our fate, we must bear it with dignity.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00028=Everything loathsome about the zerg is reflected tenfold in Amon.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00029=I still find it foolish that you went into the temple alone, if you must know.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00030=You have avenged my people, Artanis. We will never forget this.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00031=We lead our people in their darkest hour, Artanis.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00032=You say Zeratul sought this Keystone as well? Interesting...
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00033=I hope that you are right, and this technology will be our salvation... But only time will tell.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00034=We stand at the crossroads of the old ways and the new.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00035=The Tal'darim had better not be lying.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00036=Artanis... I will not let you die down there.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00037=It is a relief to see you here, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00038=The Queen of Blades is now our ally? It is too much to bear.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00039=You are bold, Artanis... sometimes a little too reckless. But it has worked in your favor.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00040=I think we are all pleased by your success with the Purifiers. Well, except the preserver over there.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00041=May those terrans find peace in death.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00042=Karax did well. I think he will make a fine templar.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00043=You have brought reason to the Aiur protoss, Artanis. I trust you will do the same with the Tal'darim.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00044=Slayn? Is their homeworld truly named Slayn? What nonsense.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00045=Raszagal would approve of you, Artanis.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00046=Adun toridas.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00047=We haven't much time.
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00048=What is going on here?
Conversation/pResponse_DTLeader/Line00049=Something is wrong with Rohana...

Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00009=An alliance with the Nerazim? The protoss have changed more than I ever could have imagined.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00010=The dark templar are heretics, exiles... We must be on our guard.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00011=You are unlike the other leaders I have known.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00012=Why have we come here?
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00013=These... terrans... seem to be a species in the early stages of their development.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00014=Take caution, Hierarch. The Dae'Uhl binds us.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00015=You dare too much, Artanis. Your youth makes you rash.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00016=Not even Judicator Doraelus would have taken such risks! Or Judicator Saldrian... Hm, well... perhaps. But that is not the point.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00017=Amon's forces are already spreading throughout the sector. I fear none will survive this onslaught without our aid.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00018=To find the xel'naga... Dare we dream of it?
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00019=So many myths and legends speculate on the birthplace of the xel'naga... Though, of course, they are all wrong.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00020=Even I cannot predict how this mystery will unfold.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00024=If you would listen to me just once...
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00025=The Purifiers are dangerous. Perhaps you must learn this firsthand.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00026=They cannot all be like Fenix, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00028=I see now that I misjudged your terran friends, Artanis. They are nothing like Moebius Corps.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00030=How unfortunate that most of the Tal'darim are blind to their fate.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00031=Amon does not care for the lives of protoss.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00032=Alarak may seem untrustworthy, but I think he lacks the finesse for deceit.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00033=So this is life without the Khala...
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00034=I shall try to view our history in this new way of yours, Artanis.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00035=Amon's mind is naught but darkness. Whatever glory he possessed fled long ago.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00036=You fought well, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00038=Our people have never faced such risks before. You will overcome them, Artanis. I know this.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00039=The wisdom of our ancestors goes with you, Artanis, first Hierarch of the Daelaam, leader of the united protoss.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00040=Bring us peace.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00041=Alarak thinks too little of his people. They are still protoss. They will come to see Amon for what he is.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00042=And so the protoss are united for the first time in over a millennium.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00043=The shadow has lifted...
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00044=So much pain in these memories... Pain without purpose or end.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00045=You have the Purifiers' cooperation? Well, that is something.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00046=Amon has decimated many worlds, Artanis. Their inhabitants are gone... They exist only in memory now. 
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00047=The origin of our kind was founded on lies...
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00048=Amon revels in his deceit. He felt no fear when I learned the truth--only pride.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00049=Our traditions and laws are not meaningless. They have kept us alive.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00050=The Purifier technology cannot aid us, Hierarch. It is flawed to its core. Will you not heed the warnings of the past?
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00051=I abandoned everything I knew to study and serve the Khala. I will not forsake my vows--even now.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00052=Truly... those terran mouths. Disgusting.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00053=I never thought I would see the day when we would aid the Nerazim against a common enemy.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00054=Change is all I may rely on anymore.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00055=This Artanis is unlike other leaders I have known.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00056=I could see the truth of Amon while he spoke through me... He claims his cause is noble, but only darkness and rage fester within.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00057=The Golden Armada's return has been delayed, but not prevented. We must destroy Amon's host form while he is still vulnerable.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00058=The Conclave would never have approved using the Spear of Adun, the last refuge of our civilization, to assist the dark ones.
Conversation/pResponse_Preserver/Line00059=I will admit I was wrong about the Purifiers. It was a great risk you faced, but you have risen above it.

Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00002=These records are fascinating, Artanis. I can hardly believe the stories they contain.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00004=I once led an expedition to rescue the last surviving brother of four zealots. The squadron was killed except for myself and the target.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00005=A scout crashed near the borders of Antiga. I gathered twenty warriors, and we slaughtered a thousand zerg to save the pilot.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00006=A nuclear device detonated in the heart of New Antioch.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00009=A Khalai worker and I fought through an underground railway system to defeat the brother of the warlord I killed in that tower three years earlier.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00010=It is good to see peace between the protoss once more.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00011=If the Conclave knew what you had done... Hah.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00012=Tassadar would be proud of you, old friend.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00013=I hope I have not forgotten too much.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00014=These alien warriors are strange, yet resilient.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00015=Thank you for helping me, Artanis.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00016=So many questions...
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00017=Is there something you cannot say to me, Artanis?
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00018=These gaps in my memory...
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00021=I do not trust Alarak. His sense of honor is... lacking.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00022=Yes, Hierarch. We will find our own paths.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00023=I will unite the Purifiers in purpose.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00024=Thank you for placing your trust in me.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00026=There is much to be done.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00028=These Tal'darim have strange customs...
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00029=I cannot bring myself to hope for Alarak's victory, but I also cannot hope for his defeat...
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00030=What will happen to Alarak if he fails? I am merely curious.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00031=You have already done much to ensure a new day for our people.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00032=That first psi-blade... It is strange how something so small can mean so much.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00033=We fight for a new dawn.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00034=That was a close fight, but then, our forces shine brightest in the darkness.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00035=You were right to say that Aiur has changed completely. But there is still hope.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00036=Amon has underestimated us at every turn, and that shall be our weapon against him.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00037=You have become a mighty leader, Artanis... a true successor to Tassadar.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00038=I know we will find victory with your guidance.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00039=I am honored by your trust.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00040=Alarak is truly a fierce warrior, despite his other shortcomings.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00041=I suppose you are right, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00042=Memory is only the beginning of who I will become.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00043=And so Shakuras becomes one with the eternal twilight.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00044=The Nerazim possess great honor--sacrificing their home to save their people.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00045=We shall return the protoss to glory!
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00046=Raynor is a valiant terran. Small, but valiant.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00047=Fate has reunited us for a great cause.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00048=There is no peril that cannot be conquered by unity.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00049=Everything I knew... belonged to someone else.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00050=I have much to reflect upon.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00051=Fenix... Yes, it is a fitting name for both of us.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00052=I will continue his legacy.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00053=The Purifiers are ready for our next battle.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00054=I hope James Raynor and his allies will now remain safe from Moebius Corps.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00055=You have a gift, Artanis. You must relish it.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00056=Fenix always saw promise in you, and now I see it fulfilled.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00057=Shortly after they killed my legion, I was captured by mercenaries. They were trying to stage a coup, demanding that I assassinate Aldaris.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00058=After breaking free, I hunted them down one by one. It was a good way to let off some steam.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00059=The Khalathi Intercession was a difficult time. Proud warriors who fought for Aiur were met with hostility when they returned.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00060=Aldera's judicator insisted I leave, my fellow templar were ordered to fire upon me. I did what I had to do to defend myself.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00061=A disgraced executor and his legion seized control of a facility known as "the Rock." Thankfully, I subdued them before it was purified.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00062=While attempting to negotiate the release of hostages on a border world, I encountered an unknown alien species.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00063=It separated us from each other. Hunted us like prey. Despite my lack of weaponry, I defeated it in martial combat and survived its explosive suicide.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00064=Praetor Adamis requested my presence for the decommissioning of the super carrier Antimond.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00065=When it was seized by a group of turncoats and traitors, I knew I could not let it fall into rebel hands.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00066=So many stories, Artanis. Each more unbelievable than the last.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00067=Some of these tales must have been embellished by their authors. It is difficult to believe one zealot could achieve so much.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00068=During the sacred celebration of Khas'mas, I was locked within a Conclave tower as it was overtaken by Dark Templar terrorists.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00069=After walking barefoot across shards of khaydarin crystal, I slew the terrorists and the warlord leading them with their own warp blades.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00070=A Tal'darim warrior invades our ship while our Hierarch is missing. I do not like this, Matriarch.
Conversation/pResponse_ProtossAI/Line00071=Never turn your back on a Tal'darim. In fact, if he so much as glares at you... put him down. It will be easier on all of us.

Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00002=I have always been fascinated by dark templar innovations.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00003=Thank you again for saving my life, Hierarch. I owe you a great debt.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00004=It is fortunate that some dark templar remained here to defend Shakuras.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00005=At least the Nerazim are safe now. I hope we will be able to rescue our brethren on Aiur soon.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00006=I cannot believe you survived the fight in the temple, Hierarch. Did you have some weapons enhancements I did not know about?
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00007=So the terrans really do fire primitive projectiles at their enemies! I had always wondered if it was true.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00008=This Keystone is full of mysteries...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00009=Many do not fully understand artificial intelligences, but I believe them to be more reliable than organic lifeforms when it comes to making decisions.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00010=It pleases me that you are willing to explore the Purifier program, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00011=This Keystone contains more information than I could ever hope to understand.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00012=We were all quite concerned for you, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00013=Our plan worked! My calculations indicated a high rate of success, but... I am still pleased.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00014=You have seen what few would understand. 
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00015=I will fight for you however I can.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00016=You have bestowed a great honor on me. I shall never forget this day.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00017=Can we trust Amon's former allies?
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00019=Our kin... part of Amon? We cannot let that come to pass.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00020=Hierarch...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00021=Your friends are most unusual, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00022=Everyone I knew was on Aiur. My fellow smiths, my teachers...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00023=Losing the Khala... is like losing a limb... a part of myself.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00024=The Grand Preserver is not cross with me, I hope?
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00025=The Spear of Adun is truly a marvel of engineering, and yet... I feel I cannot fully appreciate it given all that has transpired.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00026=I grew up hearing rumors of Glacius and the work that was done here...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00027=There must be a scientific explanation for all of this... 
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00028=I am trying to get some data readings on our location. Trying and failing.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00029=If there are answers, I will find them.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00030=All of our engineering, our advancements, are so small and simple compared to the Keystone.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00031=I hope our Hierarch is safe.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00032=This energy storm is making it impossible for me to gather any readings...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00033=This will be a delicate operation.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00034=The Purifiers on Cybros still contain the personalities of our greatest warriors. I wonder who we shall encounter among them?
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00035=The Purifier program deserves vindication, Hierarch.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00039=The Tal'darim preference for dark metals is most peculiar.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00040=I hope Alarak does not try anything foolish, but oddly enough, Fenix hopes he does. I do not quite understand it.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00041=If you think terrazine sounds dangerous, wait until you learn about Sundrop...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00042=The Grand Preserver was clever to think of the power structures. 
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00043=Many of my friends are in the Golden Armada, Hierarch. I have to do all I can to save them.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00044=Here we are, then... back where our journey started.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00045=It was quite different fighting alongside Fenix there...
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00046=Amon nearly succeeded in using the Khala to destroy us. How fitting that we may now turn it against him. 
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00047=If nothing else, I believe in our crew, Hierarch. I believe in your leadership.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00048=En aru'din Shakuras... You were our salvation, and we will forever remember that.
Conversation/pResponse_Smith/Line00049=The Templar and the Tal'darim have joined forces... Unbelievable.

Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00021=I need no rest. Give me enemies to slaughter!
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00022=Hmph. This ship is stifling.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00023=The psi-matrix is destroyed. Let us now take our fight to Amon!
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00024=Forget these machines! The Tal'darim will win this war.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00025=Oh, you speak with your minions too often. Their opinions do not matter--only mine do.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00026=Feel no remorse, Artanis. Amon would have killed Moebius Corps when they had served their purpose.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00027=Oh, Amon has lost his precious hybrid factory... Such a tragedy.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00028=Highlord sounds more impressive than Hierarch, don't you think?
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00029=You did well to aid me. Now I shall repay you by pretending to follow your orders.
Conversation/pResponse_TaldarimHero/Line00030=I look forward to being liberated from this ship--be it in victory or death.
