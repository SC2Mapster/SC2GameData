VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Heal01=You better visit that healing fountain!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Retreat00=I'm going back for a bit.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Retreat01=I need a breather.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Uhoh00=Aw, no!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Uhoh01=Focus, Lena. Everyone's counting on you!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/AI_Uhoh02=Ooo...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack00=Enough of your rubbish!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack01=Take this!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack02=You're going down.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack03=Locked on!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack04=Pow!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack05=Looks like you need a time out!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Attack06=Nothing to it.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Blink00=Whoa!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Blink01=Whee!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Blink02=<giggles>
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Blink03=Wicked!

VoiceOver/TracerBase/Healed00=Ah, thanks, love!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Healed01=Brilliant!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Healed02=Much better.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroAgree00=Alright everyone, let's do this!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroAgree01=Haha! Last one there's a rotten egg!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroAgree02=This is gonna be great!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroBoast00=Psh, it's in the bag!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroBoast01=We've got this one for sure!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion00=Get ready!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion01=Who's ready for action?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Chromie00=My chronal accelerator is acting up near you...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Curious00=Whoa, what are you? I mean, uh, hi.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Genji00=Genji! Ready for some sparring practice?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_LostViking00=And I thought I was lost...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Lucio00=Turn it up, Lucio!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Whoa! What's with you?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=What! Really? Ugh, I'm working with you? No way!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Overwatch00=Someone from Overwatch on my side? <chuckle> This'll be easy.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Am I ever glad to see you!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroQuestion_Scary00=You... are kind of scary-looking.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroRespond00=They won't see me coming.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroRespond01=Let's fight 'em together!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroRespond02=You have no idea how ready I am!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I'm gonna run circles 'round you after this.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Okay... I'll just do my best with this.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Chromie00=Please don't... Winston would never let me hear the end of it!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Ugh, okay. Fine. 
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Genji00=<Laughs>You! You're such a joker!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=There's no need to be rude.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Junkrat00=Please don't. Winston would never let me hear the end of it!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_LostViking00=I'm not in the future, I'm in the present! I think?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Lucio00=Race you to the end of the match!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Winston's an odd one, but you're a whole other level.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=What! No way. This can't be happening.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Overwatch00=Well, this realm could also use more heroes!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=No one can stop us when we're together!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=That was... not awesome.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Oooh, it talks!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/IntroResponse_You00=What? Were you expecting someone else? <giggles>
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Kill00=She shoots, she scores! Haha.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Kill01=(laugh) Bet that smarts!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Kill02=Haha. Speed kills.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Kill03=Take that!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Kill04=(laugh) Tip top!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillChromie00=Looks like you're out of time!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillGenji00=I know you can do better than that!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillLostViking00=You must be even more lost now, haha.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillOverwatch00=Hey! Aren't we supposed to be working together?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillPandaren00=What! Talking pandas?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Piece o' cake!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillSpreeEnd01=Who's next?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillSpreeEnd02=Anyone else?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillSpreeEnd03=Nothing's going to stop me!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillSpreeEnd04=I'm on a roll!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillTracer00=Whoa, it's me! Is my chronal accelerator malfunctioning again?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillWeird00=You look like you're from a HAL-fred Glitchbot movie.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/KillWizard00=Was that a real live wizard?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>

VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowLifeHeal00=There we go!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowLifeHeal01=Much obliged!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowLifeHeal02=You're a real life saver!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowMana00=I'm low on ammo.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowMana01=Nope! No ammo.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/LowMana02=Ammo's low.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/MatchEnd00=Aw, thanks, loves!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/MatchEnd01=Sensational!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/No00=Mm mmm.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/No01=No way.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/No02=Nope.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/No03=Nuh uh.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally needs our help!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need help!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Need help over here!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Straight to their core!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=We need these mercs for backup!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Let's attack this fort!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Take this watch tower!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Get them off our core!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Push 'em back from this fort!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Can't let 'em take our tower. Let's knock 'em back!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Ping_KillHero00=Take out this target!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed00=Tracer here!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed01=Fight for the future!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed02=I've been all over my world, so it's good to see some new ones.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed03=Not sure how I ended up here, but it's actually not the worst thing that's happened to me...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed04=Being lost in time was really scary! Sometimes I'd have these strange dreams about the olden days, like I was a kitchen maid in this grand house in the country!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed05=My friend Winston made this accelerator for me. I'm still not sure about all the things it does, though. Like this switch. <SFX: Switch flipped><SFX: Next line is slowed down>Whoa! <SFX: Switch flips again, and she's back to normal> Okay, I won't do that again.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed06=Having to wear a chronal accelerator is pretty weird, but at least I'm always on time for things!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed07=Being in Overwatch wasn't all fun and games, you know. I've seen things that have made my hair stand on end... <laughs>
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed08=Heroes, adventurers, oddities... Looks like they've all made it to the Nexus. Little bit heavy on the oddities...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed09=This place has even worse security than the Overwatch museum.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed10=Why can't the other heroes move while they shoot? It's a lot more practical!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed11=<in the middle of a long story>So then I realized I'd left Winston's extra peanut butter in Reinhardt's helmet! And he was trying to pull it off but it just wouldn't budge. And Torbjörn laughed and laughed... That was a good one.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pissed12=Anyone know if they have a good chip sarnie here? I'm starving!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck00=Gotcha!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck01=Right on target!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck02=Nailed it!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck03=Locked on!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck04=You need a time out!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Stuck_Evo00=Gotcha...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Successful00=(laugh) Smashing!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Successful01=Someone set up you... the bomb!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Successful02=Cracking!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Successful03=Boom!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Successful_Evo00=Smash.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw00=Here you go!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw01=Time's up!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw02=Wait for it...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw03=Bomb's away!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw_Evo00=Here ya go...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Pulsebomb_Throw_Evo01=Time up...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete00=Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete01=Now, where were we?
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete02=Just in time!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete03=Let's try that again.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete_Evo00=Déjà vu...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/RecallComplete_Evo01=Where were we...
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Resurrected00=Ahh, thanks, doc!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Resurrected01=Nice save!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Resurrected02=Yeah!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Revive00=Whew! Back to work!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Revive01=And she's back in the game!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Revive02=Well, that just happened.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Revive03=Back in the fight!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Revive04=Wait for me!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Spec00=Hey, haha, that looks neat!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Spec01=Nice choice!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Spec02=Woo!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Spec03=Oh, I like that one.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Spec04=Perfect!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Taunt00=Time is on my side!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Taunt01=I think you need a time out!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/Taunt02=Either I've gotten faster or you're way too slow.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/TeamKilled00=Chin up, team! We'll get them back.
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_ExLocked00=Look out world, Tracer's here!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Hiya!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_Gift00=I get to make someone's day? Brilliant!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_Lockin00=Cheers, love, the cavalry's here!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_Purchase00=The world could always use more heroes!

VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Hey, this is no time for standing around!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Keep calm and... Keep calm and... Keep calm and Tracer on!
VoiceOver/TracerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Be right back!
