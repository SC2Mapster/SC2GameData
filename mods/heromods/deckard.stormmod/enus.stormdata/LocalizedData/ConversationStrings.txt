VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroKill03=I see there is yet justice in this realm.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroKill04=Perhaps the forces of evil are weaker here?
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroKill05=There is still hope for these lands!
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroKill06=What becomes of these slain heroes' souls, I wonder?
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSelect00=Ready yourselves, warriors. A great battle is upon you.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSelectPlayer00=What is this strange magic? Is that me?
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSelectPlayer01=Some foul creature has disguised itself as me!
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSelectPlayer02=I always wondered if I had a long-lost twin...
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSelect_Observer00=Behold! The forces of light and darkness shall clash anew!
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSlain00=One of our warriors has paid the ultimate price.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSlain01=Another soul has departed this world.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSlain02=Do not be discouraged, friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSlain03=Remember this--you must always keep fighting.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/HeroSlain04=Must our enemies torment us so?

VoiceOver/DeckardA/PlayerAbandon00=A warrior has left the battlefield.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/PlayerAbandon01=How unfortunate. An ally has departed.

VoiceOver/DeckardA/SpreeEnd00=Your killing spree is over.
VoiceOver/DeckardA/SpreeEnd01=I haven't seen so many deaths since the Reign of the Black King.

VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Caution00=Beware!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_GoodJob00=You are a fine warrior, my friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_GoodJob01=Even these old eyes can see your skill.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_GoodJob02=It is magnificent watching you fight!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Heal00=You need to heal.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Heal01=Oof! Doesn't that hurt? Go and heal.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Retreat00=I'm going to stay back! Back!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Retreat01=This calls for a retreat.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Uhoh00=No! My poor friend...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Uhoh01=Wait! I need you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/AI_Uhoh02=<sigh> This is not what I planned!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack00=For the Horadrim!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack01=Foul minions!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack02=Enough of you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack03=Go to your graves!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack04=I am surrounded by fiends!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Attack05=You bring great evil upon us!

VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Healed01=Ah, I feel a few years younger...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Healed02=I truly needed that!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroAgree00=Very well.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroAgree01=I pray that is true.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroAgree02=We must stop them or all will be lost.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroBoast00=They will not be expecting someone like me.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroBoast01=As the Last Horadrim, I will protect this land.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready for the terrible battle ahead?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion01=<laughs> I hope you are better prepared for this than I am.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=I always prayed your kind would fight for us at last!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_D2Hero00=I could never forget your face, hero.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=We have many enemies here, nephalem.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Back to the Burning Hells with you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=I would rather die than fight for you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Can you never find peace, King Leoric?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Well, aren't you a strange little thing?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Why must it be you?!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Oh, it's you! What a fortunate turn of events.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_PrimeEvilDiablo00=Leah... I know you're still in there. You must break free!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=It is an honor to see you again, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroRespond00=I have studied the forces of evil for many long years.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroRespond01=If my long travels did not steel my nerves, nothing will.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroRespond02=I will always fight against the darkness.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=We are more than what we seem.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=I condemn your kind and all you stand for!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=How can this be?!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_D2Hero00=Hah, do not overestimate me after all we've seen together.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Hah! You were always my favorite champion to fight alongside.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=The forces of light will vanquish you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Yes, it is me. And once again, I will find a way to defeat you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Gibberish00=You speak in a tongue even I do not comprehend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Better than your attempts to resist the demons.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=I must write a book about you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=You will have much to account for when this is over.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=I cannot tell you what a relief this is!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_PrimeEvilDiablo00=Oh Leah... I never knew. I am so sorry.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Sad00=Alas, that we have lived to see such times.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyrael! This is a happy reunion indeed.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill00=Scholars are more dangerous than brutes.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill01=Ha! Look at that.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill02=Fate has frowned on you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill03=And stay dead!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill04=The power of knowledge prevails!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Kill05=Age before... whatever you are.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillAngel00=You never helped us as much as you could have.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillD2Hero00=Oh! Sorry for that, my friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillD3Hero00=Was that you, nephalem?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillDemon00=This realm is not yours to corrupt!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillDiablo00=That was for Tristram!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillLeoric00=Eternal peace awaits you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillMephisto00=Your hatred will not take hold here!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillOlder00=I think you're even older than I am!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillPrimeEvilDiablo00=May you find peace at last, Leah.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Maybe now you'll learn to respect your elders.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/KillTyrael00=Tyrael! Oh, I hope you do not remember that.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Laugh00=<small chuckle>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Laugh02=<big laugh>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Oh, thank the Heavens for you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowLifeHeal01=It is kind of you to heal me, friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowLifeHeal02=You heal like a Zakarum priestess! <happy sigh>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowMana00=I am short on mana.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowMana01=My mana is too low.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/LowMana02=Insufficient mana.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/MatchEnd00=Well, I must say I'm impressed!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/MatchEnd01=How wonderful!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/MatchEnd02=Well, I-I suppose I did all right.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/No00=What? No!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/No01=That is impossible.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/No02=Absolutely not!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=A friend has need of us!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Help, help!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Aid me!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Bring the battle to their core!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Persuade these mercenaries to join us.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Tear down their fort!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Lay claim to this watch tower.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Keep them away from our core!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=This fort requires our protection!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Guard this watch tower.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ping_KillHero00=Confront this dangerous hero!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed00=Good day, my friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed01=There is so much to be done.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed02=Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed03=The Horadric Cube is quite a treasure. It took many years of research and study to uncover its secrets... And it's also a charming foot rest.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed04=None of the tomes I have read foretold of heroes coming to a faraway land. What if fate has been forever changed?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed05=Has anyone seen my dear niece, Leah? She's brave, kind, and disinclined to believe in any of my stories? <sigh>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed06=I have seen many strange realms in my time. I've traveled across Khanduras, Kehjistan, and even Pandemonium. But the Nexus yet defies my understanding.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed07=Would you like me to identify some of these places for you? It would be my pleasure.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed08=Raven Court is a mysterious, shadowy realm. It seems to be controlled by the Raven Lord, who is one of the oldest and most powerful rulers within these lands.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed09=Luxoria is the most unique of the Nexus realms I have seen, with its own pantheon of gods, including the Ka and the Spider Queen Neithis. I do not know what became of the others, but their absence bodes ill...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed10=Mistharbor has been in turmoil since the spirit of Blackheart began terrorizing the docks with his ghost ship. It would take a truly brave warrior to depose him...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed11=King's Crest is the most beautiful of the Nexus realms. Its history is intertwined with the fate of the Dragon Knight and the Lady of Thorns. If only there was something we could do to bring them peace.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed12=It is really very simple to get around here, provided you have the correct directions. Just buckle up and listen!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed13=Begin by proceeding in the direction of your core until you arrive at a gate. Go straight through the gate and continue moving. After some time, you will arrive at your destination. Good luck!	
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Pissed14=My name is Deckard Cain and I'm in the Nexus, our enemies are many but they'll never best us. If I find ol' Diablo even I might take him down! You should always remember that we're in a different town! <beatboxing> Ho-Horadrim, Ho-Ho-Horadrim in the house! <beat> Where's my staff?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Resurrected00=It was not yet my time.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Resurrected01=You have given me another chance, my friend.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Revive00=Oh. I came back?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Revive01=I must have had a spare potion!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Revive02=For a moment there, I thought I saw Leah...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Spec00=Now that looks interesting.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Spec01=Hm, that's just what I needed.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Spec02=How useful!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Spec03=I read about that one once...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Spec04=Yes, that will do.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Taunt00=<angry "hmph">
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Taunt01=<upset grunt>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Taunt02=<taunting chuckle>
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/TeamKilled00=The darkness prevails, but we will fight for the dawn!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Isn't there something you wish to learn?
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Good to see you!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_Gift00=An ally of yours is an ally of mine.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_Lockin00=So it begins...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_Purchase00=This is only the beginning of our journey.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_Trial00=Yes, let me introduce myself.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, the things I can tell you...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=I have witnessed much and suffered much, but there is still more to come.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Trust in my knowledge, and I will help you as I can.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=You'd better not be looking for black mushrooms over there.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Have you ever heard of a cow level? Oh nevermind...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1Used00=Stay awhile and listen...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1Used01=Stay awhile and listen.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1Used02=Stay awhile and listen.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1Used03=Stay awhile and listen.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1UsedEnemy00=The Zakarum tomes warn of a falling star in the western lands. And behold, it has come to pass, along with so much else I have studied...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1UsedEnemy01=According to ancient manuscripts, Bul-Kathos held sway in the north even as it was settled, and he led the barbarians by virtue of his strength.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1UsedEnemy02=...as I tell you my many tales of Sanctuary and the realms beyond...
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate1UsedEnemy03="Bartuc and Horazon" was one of my favorite tales, though it is a dark one--it is nonetheless true. These two Vizjerei mages shaped much of our world.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate2Used00=Ignorance will be your undoing!
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate2Used01=Wisdom can be deadly.
VoiceOver/DeckardBase/Ultimate2Used02=My scrolls contradict you!
