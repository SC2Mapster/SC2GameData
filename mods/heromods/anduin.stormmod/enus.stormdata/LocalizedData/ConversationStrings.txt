VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_AltReality00=Are you--? I mean, you look a lot like... actually, I don't want to know.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=To fight beside a being of such purity. It is an honor to be your ally.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Archer00=Excellent, we could use an accomplished archer! Steady aim, friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=Arthas? That's not possible. We defeated you... What is this place?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Auriel00=Such wondrous light... It's as if your very presence fills my heart with hope and joy.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Chromie00=Chronormu! (realizing) Oh, wait, I hope this doesn't mean the timestream is out of sorts.

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_ETC00=A-are you real? You're nothing like any tauren I've met...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=While our goals may align, I will be watching your methods closely.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Your kind of evil has no place in this world.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=Just because we are allies does not mean I am allowing you free reign.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh Hellscream. I should never have wasted my words on you.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Genn, ready to step into the breach once more, my friend?

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Horde00=There are members of the Horde with honor, and those without... Let's see which you are.

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Diplomacy is never easy. Less so with you around.

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Glad to see you on my side.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Positive01=Ha, finally an ally I can put my faith in.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Positive02=It is good to fight beside you again, my friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Probius00=Aww, aren't you a curious automaton? Where is your artificer at?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Probius01=Aww, aren't you a curious automaton? Where is your artificer at?

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Lord Uther! The Alliance has gained a powerful ally this day!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Valeera00=Valeera. You served my father faithfully for many years... thank you for that.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Valla00=Are you sure you're a demon hunter? Don't you need a blindfold or... something?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=Father!? How is this possible? We've... (correcting himself)I've had to endure so much without you...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=End this myopic crusade of yours, Whitemane. Come back to the Light!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Xul00=Xul! When this is over I'd love to learn more about the Balance... Good necromancers are such a strange concept.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=Come, Exarch. We have a battle to win. For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=The Sillithid of the Nexus look very strange... further Old God corruption, perhaps...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroRespond00=I am well prepared to do what I must.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroRespond01=Don't worry. I won't let you down.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroRespond02=A king must always be ready for war.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Alliance00=For Stormwind! For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_AltReality00=Alright, I'm just going to say it... This is weird.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=An angel?! By the light... I've read texts about your kind! I thought they were apocryphal!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=You know I'm king now, right?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Approval00=<chuckle> Excellent.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=You offer naught but slavery and torment. Any true king would see that.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Auriel00=Never lose hope.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=What was that? Are... are you trying to have a conversation? Uhm, hello?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Curious00=You'll have to expound upon that later.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=All new demons... same old mindset.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Now, is the time to stop... you're making a fool of yourself.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Dour00=You are absolutely miserable to be around... you know that?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=Evil will never prosper as long as good remains vigilant.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=<scoff> I despise even being associated with you.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Your behavior will remain in check, or I will keep it in check, myself.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=You have the full support of Stormwind!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Fine00=<scoff> Very well.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=No, Garrosh. I'm afraid you're the one who gets cut down to size.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=And as long as I live, I shall gladly give it.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=Try me, warlock. Stormwind will never fear you or your ilk again.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Horde00=Put your grievances aside. We have a common enemy to deal with... again.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Identity00=I'm sorry, but I believe you may have mistaken me for someone else...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=Being brave doesn't mean you have to seek out trouble, you know.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Jaina? Is that you? You seem... different. It's like I'm looking through time.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_JainaDread00=Strong words from one whose master is now imprisoned. Or were you unaware, demon?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_JainaModern00=I've got your back, Jaina. Always will.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Legion00=No world will bow to your foul crusade again. The Army of the Light has seen to it.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_LiMing00=Fun? Do you do this a lot?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=(sharp, he's obviously caught)Uh, nothing! I-I've just never actually spoken to dryad before. Uhm... hi!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=The Light is with us, Archdruid. We will not falter.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Mech00=For Neo-Stormwind!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Muradin00=You first, Muradin. I'll be right behind you.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Hearing that sound come from my ally is a surreal experience.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Have you considered keeping your opinions to yourself? I hear it does wonders.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Negative01=Diplomacy is the art of knowing precisely what to say. Right now, try nothing.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Negative02=You are exhausting my patience... and we haven't even begun.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_NexusHunter00=I am accustomed to the ways of mercenaries and adventurers. I have some gold around here... uhm, uh, a blue item at least.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_No00=That, will not be happening.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Noble00=A king's decision shapes the world he lives in. I decide to ignore that.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Nova00=Look, I'm not Valerian. Or "Stormwind Valerian." Whatever that means!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Orphea00=I am, actually. Is it that easy to tell?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_OrpheaTwo00=Oh, thank you. You're not so bad yourself. <stammering> I-uhmm... I mean... I-I didn't mean it like... uh... sorry.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Never lose hope, friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Positive01=United, we can never be defeated.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Positive02=It is an honor to fight by your side, friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Protoss00=(elongated)And... you... (can't stop his curiousity)I-I'm sorry, but are a draenei? Maybe with some extreme mutation?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Ragnaros00=No.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Suspicious00=Hmm, I'm not sure about this.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Better to be a fool, than an honorless monster.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Tired00=Has anyone ever conveyed how exhausting you can be?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Tyrande00=And mine as well, Tyrande. I know I failed your people... that will not happen again.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=The Scourge. Mark my words, you will never corrupt Azeroth again.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Upset00=I've heard enough from you!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Here here! For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=Father? It's really you!? I don't believe this...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Warrior00=Uh, priest, actually. Despite the armor... and sword... eh, you know what, it's fine.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=And I consider it an honor.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/IntroResponse_Yrel00=Through unity, our Alliance grows stronger. We ARE one in the light, afterall...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill00=Be at peace.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill01=Is that all you've got?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill02=A shame.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill03=All I've ever wanted is peace...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill04=May the Light be merciful upon your soul.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Kill05=Someone could use a priest.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillAlliance00=A regrettable outcome.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillEvil00=A great malady has been expelled from this place.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillEvil01=We have done good here.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillEvil02=The darkness has been expelled.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillGarrosh00=You had every chance to change. This was your doing.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillGhost00=Be cleansed, spirit.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillHoly00=Oh... may the Light forgive me.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillHoly01=May the Light forgive me.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillHorde00=For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillJaina00=Aunt Jaina, if you're holding back for my sake, don't.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillMachine00=Anything made can be broken.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Justice has come for you! Killing spree over.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillSylvanas00=It's over, Sylvanas.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillThrall00=A leader cannot abandon the fight for peace.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/KillVarian00=You almost had me there, father. Let's duel again!

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/LowMana02=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/MatchEnd00=I thank you.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/MatchEnd01=I am humbled by the honor.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/MatchEnd02=Everything is for the Alliance.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/No00=I can't do that.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/No01=You're not serious...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/No02=No...
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally needs reinforcement!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AssistMe00=To my aid, quickly!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I require assistance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Heroes, assail their core!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Recruiting these mercenaries would be wise.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=This fort must be eliminated.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We should capture this watch tower.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Do not allow that fort to fall.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_DefendTower00=They're trying to take that watch tower. Let's stop them.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_KillHero00=We must stop this enemy!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ping_KillHero01=Eliminate that hero!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed00=Greetings friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed01=A king is only as noble as the cause he serves.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed02=Please, now is not the time for that... Also, it will NEVER be the time for that.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed03=The Light will abolish the shadow in all its forms. I, personally, would never resort to its dark methods.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed04=Except when playing Hearthstone... sometimes that game brings out the worst in me.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed05=A lot of people don't realize how difficult and awkward it is to grow up in the spotlight. Your every success, and every failure laid bare in front of the entire world... of warcraft.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed06=Hmm? Oh, actually, I am still wearing the helmet. It's just transmogrified to hidden.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed07=You know, those shadow priests are a bad influence. If one mind-controlled you and asked you to jump off a bridge would you do it? The answer is yes, by the way... Yuck.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed08=Oh, crud! I forgot to cast fortitude on the group! Ehh, I'm sure one of the other priests on the battleground will get it.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed09=When you really think about it, isn't every race in the Alliance an allied race?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed10=In pandaren board games, the goal is for both players to win. In Hearthstone, the goal is for me to beat you to death... with your own minions.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed11=There will be peace, one day. <beat> At least I think there will... How many WoW expansions are left again? <beat/exerting as if he's listening to a response> Oh? Oh! Oh... Well... well, then.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed12=Why did the priesthood call it a leap of faith? No one leaps, and it certainly doesn't require faith.... I've always thought "life-grip" would be more accurate.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed13=A paladin, a medic, a DJ, the Archangel of Hope, and a priest walk into a bar. The bartender stops them and says: "Hey! No support groups!"
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Pissed14=My father once said that everywhere the Light touches is our kingdom... <beat> But not Deadwind Pass. We don't go there.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Resurrected00=I've been resurrected? Well done, friend!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Resurrected01=I'm back... Let's keep up the pressure.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Revive00=Stomwind will endure.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Revive01=There's more to be done.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Revive02=So that's what that feels like.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Revive03=All right... Shrug it off, Anduin.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec00=Blessings of the Light.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec01=Cunning.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec02=Hm. What are you plotting?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec03=My thoughts as well.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec04=A prudent choice.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Spec05=<Chuckle> Oh, the possibilities.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Taunt00=Injustice will not stand.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Taunt01=The Banshee Queen's reign will end.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Taunt02=Some are beyond redemption.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/TeamKilled00=My father never surrendered, and neither will I.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_ExLocked00=Greetings, citizen.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Greetings, friend.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Gift00=A new journey begins.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Lockin00=For the Alliance above all!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Purchase00=It is past time I joined this fight.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Trial00=I won't let you down.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, the training grounds! Splendid.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_Vox_Spun00=<Dizzy exertion. After being spun around>

VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_WaitLocked00=The time for action is upon us.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Do you need the aid of the Alliance?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=So... Enjoying your stay in the Nexus?
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=We must fight for what we believe in. Now, would be a good time to start.
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ultimate1Used00=Gather quickly! We stand as one!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ultimate1UsedEnemy00=Stand as one! For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/AnduinBase/Ultimate2Used00=Light protect you!
