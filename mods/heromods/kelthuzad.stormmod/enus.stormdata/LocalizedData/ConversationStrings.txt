VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_BarbarianDK00=Death Knight, show them no mercy.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=The Scourge serve your kind no longer demon.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_HearthStone00=We finally meet.

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=I'm sorry... Are you lost?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Hmm, you... this presents an unfortunate complication.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=I see. An acceptable ally.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Stukov00=This infestation of yours is too similar to the plague for my liking.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylvanas the traitor... I'll have to watch my back. Lest I find an arrow in it.

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=Enough! I grow tired of this distraction.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=You too shall be scourged from this realm in time.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Interested00=An intriguing notion.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Jaina00=Ah, Antonidus's lapdog. How is he by the way? (dark)Still dead?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_JainaDread00=And so it had best remain. Your kind's penchant for betrayal is no secret, demon.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Your curiosity will be the death of you.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Your curiosity will be the death of you, Murky. Over and over again.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Be silent! ...and I may yet tolerate your presence.

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=Your suffering has (dark)yet to begin.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Undead00=For the Lich King!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=What are you implying, paladin? That all Necromancers sound alike?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_Valeera00=Okay. I. Will.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/IntroResponse_ZagaraCrypt00=Suitable? Remember who you serve, Cryptmother.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill00=The dark void awaits you!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill01=<cackles maniacally>
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill02=Another soul, banished to oblivion.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill03=You were doomed from the inception.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill04=Crumble and rot.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Kill05=What did I say about your curiosity?

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillLeoric00=No! YOU kneel!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillSpreeEnd00=That one was on a killing spree... Heh. "Was."
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillTyrael00=Was that val'kyr missing a face?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillUndead00=I have no tolerance for traitors.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillUther00=Ahh, now that takes me back.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/KillWarcraftIII00=Ah, nostalgia.

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/LowLifeHeal02=That was far too close.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/LowMana00=My mana reserves are low.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/LowMana01=I have not enough mana.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/LowMana02=I lack the mana required.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/MatchEnd00=Victory for Kel'Thuzad.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/MatchEnd01=Indeed.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/MatchEnd02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/MrBigglesworth00=No!!! A curse upon you, interloper!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/No01=An impossibility.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/No02=I refuse.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/PhylacteryDeath00=Your victory is a hollow one.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/PhylacteryDeath01=Do... not... rejoice!

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed00=You called?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed01=Is something amiss?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed02=I'm still awaiting that eternal reward, you know.... what's taking forever?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed03=Ten years ago I was a nobody. Then, I started my own religion. Now I have a glorious floating citadel and you could too if you'd just read my book: "Striking it Lich! (dark)...the Easy Way."
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed04=At this point, the Cult of the Damned is a cult classic.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed05=You "heroes" were so busy looting your precious "tier 7", you completely forgot to look for my phylactery. <laugh> Fools.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed06=Wait, there's a Lich King AND a Skeleton King? Ugh. I hate having to choose between my job and my home-life!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed07=King Arthas once forged a blade in my honor. He named it "Bloodsurge, the Blade of Agony." Honestly, it was a little much, I let him keep it.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed08=The darkness guides me. <beat> He's the only one with GPS after all.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed09=Spreading the plague was a lot easier back before everything went all "gluten free."
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed10=The best part of being a lich? Seeing my breath freeze whenever I want. <Exhaling: HAhhhh.> Neat.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed11=Originally, it took 40 heroes to defeat me. I heard Arthas got beaten by 10. Makes you question who the REAL Lich King is, doesn't it?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed12=<SFX: Cat meow.> (talking cutesy to the cat)Oh, now, don't you worry, Mr. Bigglesworth. (back to normal)I won't let ANYONE harm you this time.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed13=How dare you poke the Archlich of Naxxramas! Lich Lord of the Plaguelands, Commander of the Dread Necropolis! Master and founder of the Cult of the Damned...
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed14=Formerly of the Council of Six... Summoner of Archimonde the Defiler! The Betrayer of Humanity! Hearthstone Enthusiast, and Majordomo to the Lich King himself, KEL'THU-freaking-ZAD.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Pissed15=Oh wait, I forgot creator of the abomination! Can we take it again from the top? <beat> What do you mean, no? <slightly longer beat> Fine... but I'm taking your soul for this!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete1st00=The shadow grows.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete1st01=<laugh> My power expands.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete2nd00=Faster and faster now.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete2nd01=Let the onslaught commence!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete3rd00=The master has granted me true strength!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/QuestComplete3rd01=Yes, this is the power promised me!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Resurrected00=You made the correct choice.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Resurrected01=The Shadowlands will NOT take me.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Revive00=The ancient evil survives.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Revive01=I am reborn.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Revive02=The Lich King has granted me eternal life.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Revive03=Getting some use out of that phylactery, I see.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Spec00=I bask in untold power...
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Spec01=Yes, that will be of great benefit.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Spec02=Mm, I'll have to trust you on that one.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Spec03=A rational decision.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Spec04=The eternal enigma unfurls.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Taunt00=Pray for mercy!

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_Purchase00=Hear that, Mr. Bigglesworth? It's our turn now.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_Trial00=A test? Good thing I'm always prepared.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, I have been aching to unleash my power.

VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_VOX_Dizzy08=<Dizzy exertions. After being spun around.>
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_VOX_Dizzy09=<Dizzy exertions. After being spun around.>
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=My patience IS limited, you know.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I have been waiting a LONG time for this. Don't make me wait any longer.
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Why are you wasting my time? Explain yourself, minion!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Who dares violate the sanctity of... wherever I am?
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Ultimate1Used00=I will freeze the blood in your veins!
VoiceOver/KelthuzadBase/Ultimate1Used01=Frozen wastes, obey my call!
