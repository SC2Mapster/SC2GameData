Character/Description/Auriel=The Archangel of Hope, Auriel is a powerful force for peace and harmony. She has fought demons since the beginning of creation, but always seeks to find some way to bring all of creation to a state of peace, even if that means she must fight to do so. She is a powerful warrior, and an advisor to all of the angels. Without her, Heaven would have fallen apart long ago.

VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion01=Be ready and able. Conflict arises.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Alien00=In all of creation, I have never encountered your kind before. But I trust you are well versed in combat.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Angel00=Your presence warms my spirit, sibling.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=You are a seething monstrosity. Do not interfere with my task.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Curious00=You are most unusual, but hope is universal.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=It is an honor to fight alongside you, nephalem.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Can you put aside our differences long enough for us to ensure victory, demon?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=I always believed in the potential of mortals. You have proven me correct.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Guldan00=You manipulated the hope of your people to further your own power. Deplorable.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Hope00=Embrace your hope. It shall lead us to victory in the end.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Imperius00=Do try to keep a level head, brother.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=You acted on faith, King Leoric. But hope alone could not save you.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Someday, you will be home again.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hmm, what manner of creature are you?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Oh, it is you... what a shame.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hail, friend. Your presence is most welcome.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=It fills me with joy to see you again, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroQuestion_Upset00=Your words are meant to wound me, but they only harm yourself.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroRespond00=Hold onto hope. It will not abandon you.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroRespond01=Verily.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroRespond02=After an eternity of conflict, I am always ready.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Alien00=I will aid you in this battle... whatever you are.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Angel00=Let us sing the song of the Crystal Arch.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=You do not speak with words, yet your stench says all that is required.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Curious00=We make for a strange fellowship. But it is one I shall honor nonetheless.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=You are ever a font of hope.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=Your words seep with poison and lies.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Come, mortal. You have my aid and blessing.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Hope shines upon all creatures, even ones as undeserving as you.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Guldan00=That is not the word I would use to describe this alliance.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Imperius00=As always, I will be watching over you.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Only that I wish the High Heavens could have aided your kingdom.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=Do not be so quick to discredit them. Together, you are strong.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Seek justice, young one. Vengeance, if you must. But do not abandon hope.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=You should channel that aggression toward our enemies.

VoiceOver/AurielBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=I am unsure how to aid you, exactly. But I know I will find a way.

VoiceOver/AurielBase/Kill01=Your part in this is over.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Kill02=I pray this time, you find peace.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Kill03=A necessary course.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Kill04=We march ever closer toward harmony.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillAngel00=I do what must be done.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillAuriel00=Hope against hope, indeed.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillAzmodan00=The wages of Sin is death, and your debt is now paid.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillButcher00=You shall feed no more, demon.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillChoGall00=Hmph. And I thought Tyrael and Imperius had sibling rivalry...
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillD3Hero00=A pity... I placed MY hope in YOU, nephalem.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillDiablo00=Diablo is dead. And all evil with him. For now.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/KillLeoric00=Fear not, Leoric. You shall return soon enough.

VoiceOver/AurielBase/LowLifeHeal01=Thank you, you have pushed back the darkness.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LowLifeHeal02=My deepest thanks are yours.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LowMana00=I am low on mana.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LowMana01=My mana is diminished.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LowMana02=I have insufficient mana.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LrgHealStored00=A massive heal has been stored.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/LrgHealStored01=Massive heal stored.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MaxHealStored00=I am at the healing storage maximum.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MaxHealStored01=My healing storage has reached its maximum.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MaxHealStored02=Maximum healing stored.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MaxHealStored03=Maximum healing storage attained.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MedHealStored00=I hold a large healing in waiting.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/MedHealStored01=Large heal stored.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/No00=No, that is forbidden.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/No01=I cannot honor your request.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/No02=That cannot be.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/No03=Impossible.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Assist our ally.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I require your aid, heroes.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AssistMe01=The enemy is upon me.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Assail their core.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Enlisting these mercenaries would be wise.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=This fort should be eradicated.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Capture this watchtower.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core!
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We should defend this fort.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_DefendTower00=We should take this watch tower from our foes.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ping_KillHero00=Should we not eliminate this threat?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed00=How may I aid you mortal?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed01=Speak, and I shall listen.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed02=Take heart, my friends. Faith cannot be lost. Only abandoned.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed03=Never forget, young ones. Hope is not passive. It is easily confused with inactive desire. No, true hope is a blessing, a glorious harmony that is granted through the result of one's deeds.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed04=When it was put to a vote, I cast mine for the preservation of Sanctuary and all of the mortals who call it home. I'm still undecided on the Nexus.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed05=Tyrael, Auriel, Maltheal, Itherael... and Imperius. Ugh. He always has to be the one who stands out.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed06=Al'maiesh is the Cord of Hope. Through it flows all of my power. I tried going cordless for a while, but I had to recharge every two hours.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed07=Angels don't actually need wings to fly, you know. We just need to think some happy thoughts. (Sighs) And that's why we ride horses.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed08=What are you looking at? Do I have something on my face? Oh, no... of course not.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed09=Remember, hope floats. Which I think is quite the accomplishment, given this suit of armor.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed10=Someday, Imperius might actually calm down and think things through before he acts. He's always been such a hothead.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed11=When Diablo invaded the High Heavens, he had Rakanoth imprison me within the Library of Fate. Our situation was rather... hopeless.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed12=In truth, we angels are luminous beings. Not this crude metal.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed13=Leoric has made a habit of draining hope from creation. I used to take pity on his ill fate, but he is significantly increasing my workload.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Pissed14=The mortal known as Tracer told me of a dish from her world called "angel hair" pasta. Why must these mortals be so morbid?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Resurrected00=Ah, the secrets of resurrection are familiar to you as well.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Resurrected01=Thank you, I am grateful to serve once more.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Revive00=Hope springs eternal.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Revive01=The light of the Crystal Arch shines on.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Revive02=Tarry not. Our allies are in need.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Revive03=I am returned.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Spec00=An inspired choice.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Spec01=Indeed.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Spec02=The light surges...
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Spec03=A gift from the High Heavens.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Spec04=Yes, this shall suffice.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Taunt00=When hope itself stands against you, what chance do you have left?
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Taunt01=In the face of adversity hope's light shines the brightest.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Taunt02=Disharmony will not be tolerated.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/TeamKilled00=In the face of adversity hope's light shines the brightest.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_ExLocked00=Hail to you, champion.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_ExPurchased00=May you ever walk in heaven's light.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_Gift00=Your ally is as mine.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_Lockin00=There is ALWAYS hope.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_Purchase00=Our fates are united.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_Trial00=Through great trial, new bonds are forged.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_Trial01=A challenge, is it? Let us begin.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Surely you require my help...
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Allow me to join your fight, my friend.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Do not waste time, mortal. As I understand it, your kind does not have that much of it.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hm. I fear for the fate of the High Heavens without me.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ultimate2Used00=Have faith and none shall harm you.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ultimate2Used01=Let my blessing be your shield!
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ultimate2Used02=Hold fast to hope, my friend.
VoiceOver/AurielBase/Ultimate2Used03=I have you! Know not fear!
