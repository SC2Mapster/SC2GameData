DocInfo/DescLong=We are proud to present the winning entry of our first Mutation Creation contest, as designed and submitted by Saito. In this weekly challenge, vile replications of the Koprulu sector's greatest heroes inspire Amon’s forces as they lay siege to Augustgrad. Do not back down in the face of their presence, and focus on saving the city.
