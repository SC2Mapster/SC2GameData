Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00160=[Surprise 70]A small reminder[/Surprise]--[Serious]your foes are still attacking a device whilst you take another one.[/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00161=[Serious 75]An extraction device requires additional defenses, Nova.[/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00162=[Fear 60]A device is currently besieged by the infested.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00163=[Surprise 65]Just so you know[/Surprise], [Angry 75]our extraction device is not faring [Surprise 80]well [/Surprise]against our foes.[/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00164=[Angry 75]The device cannot hold against further attacks. Repel the infested, or it will fall![/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00165=[Angry 75]The infested have severely damaged a device, [Surprise 70]Nova[/Surprise]![/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00166=[Sad 65]Our device needs additional protection, [Angry 70]or it shall be ruined[/Angry].[/Sad]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00167=You may have impressed Highlord Alarak in our last battle, but you haven't impressed me.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00168=Seal a terrazine source! Let none of the terrans defile it with their presence.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00169=We have safeguarded more of the terrazine, Highlord. Truly, you cannot consider these terrans to be worthy opponents?
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00170=How ashamed they must feel to see us close off this terrazine as well...
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00171=[Serious 75]Nova, we cannot acquire terrazine from this device any longer.[/Serious] [Angry 70]If we lose too many of them, we shall lose the challenge.[/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00172=Attention Dominion forces, we need evac! If you help us, we'll help you!

Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00174=Please... kill me...
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00175=[Angry 65]Be on your guard, Nova. Those overlords are carrying [Surprise 70]additional forces[/Surprise]![/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00176=Terminate another extraction device, and teach these weaklings a lesson.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00177=I grow tired of this pathetic battle. Destroy another device, now.

Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00182=[Serious 70]We're ready to[Surprise 70] gather some[/Surprise] terrazine. [/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00183=[Angry 75]Damn it![/Angry] [Surprise 65]I think I found the missing researchers, Reigel[/Surprise]... [Sad 60]They're all infested.[/Sad]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00184=[Serious 70]Nova, the Umojan records indicate that the researchers had additional mines here. I'd imagine they had to[/Serious] [Happy 65]leave some equipment behind.[/Happy]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00185=[Angry 70]Nova, the Tal'darim have destroyed one of the extraction devices.[/Angry] [Fear 60]We will not be able to collect terrazine from it.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00186=Strike a device, Tal'darim! We must protect the Breath of Creation with all our might.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00187=Another device has been shut down. This terrazine will not fall into the hands of those imbeciles!
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00188=[Angry 60][Sad 65]Your time runs short, Nova. The Tal'darim have already ruined most of the devices.[/Sad][/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00189=[Angry 60]They are moving to attack a device.[/Angry] [Fear 60]If they are successful, there will be one less source of terrazine available to us.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00190=[Serious 70]You have already agitated the enemy[/Serious]. Activating more [Fear 60]devices will incur additional risk.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00191=The infested killed our warriors before they reached the device! If this was Rak'Shir, I'd throw you all in the pit...
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00192=Some of our forces were slain by the infested? That is no honorable death, even if it was in combat...
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00193=[Surprise 70]Nova[/Surprise], [Serious 70]I see you're starting up another device[/Serious]... [Angry 50][Serious 60]Be sure you have enough forces to defend against the infested[/Serious].[/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00194=[Serious 70]Do be careful extracting from that new device[/Serious]. [Fear 60]It will disturb more of the infested.[/Fear]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00195=[Serious 65][Surprise 60]Nova[/Surprise], the Tal'darim are contacting us directly...[/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00196=I will be competing with you for the terrazine in this challenge. May the best warrior ascend to victory.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00197=I expect you to keep your distance from my outpost unless you desire a painful death.
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00198=[Angry 70]You'd best humor her[/Angry]. [Serious 75]She sounds serious, and our fight lies elsewhere.[/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00199=You are even more foolish than I thought. Very well, then. Prepare to meet your end!
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00200=[Angry 60]Strange... There's some kind of creature inside the device...[/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00201=[Surprise 70]I did mention it's biomechanical engineering.[/Surprise]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00202=[Angry 75]Proceed with caution.[/Angry] My scans show [Surprise 75][Fear 75]infested... siege tanks nearby![/Fear][/Surprise]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00203=I will not be bested by these weaklings again. Warriors, ready your weapons!

Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00205=[Angry 65][Happy 75]Yes--twice, now[/Happy][/Angry]. [Surprise 65]Where is Highlord Alarak?[/Surprise]
Conversation/Mission_Nova05/Line00206=[Surprise 65]I found it[/Surprise]! But what are you going to [Surprise 70]use it for[/Surprise]?

Conversation/Mission_Nova06/Line00144=[Angry 60]Didn't the Dominion brass say that feral zerg attacks [Surprise 70]weren't a threat now?[/Surprise][/Angry][Serious 70] I wonder what changed.[/Serious]
Conversation/Mission_Nova06/Line00145=Must be something big. Takes a lot of time and money to make security equipment like this.
Conversation/Mission_Nova06/Line00146=[Serious 70]If it works like Maxwell says, this tech could be [Surprise 65]a big help to us [/Surprise]out in the field. [/Serious][Angry 65][Surprise 65]Why[/Surprise] hasn't anyone told us [Surprise 70]about it?[/Surprise][/Angry]
Conversation/Mission_Nova06/Line00147=Could be an oversight... could be they're lying to us. Either way, I don't like it.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_010/Comment00003=NOVA is unconscious, slumped in a chair. She wears a hostile environment suit and a high tech visor that can be lowered over her eyes. A spotlight shines down on her and she wakes up.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00004=A flash of light fills the cockpit. A Dominion ship warps into her field of vision.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00012=The door slides open. Another pair of marines enter. They step apart to reveal HORNER. Nova's surprised to see him.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00013=Nova's cautious, eyes scanning the room and everyone in it. Something's not adding up here. She stands at attention.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00014=He stares at her, brow furrowed.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00017=Nova's shock shows itself for a second before she masks it. The pieces start falling into place.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00018=Horner seems conflicted. Doesn't like what he's about to do. But a job's a job.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00019=On Nova, stunned. What comes next is the coup de grace.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Comment00020=The guards tense up. Nova quickly assesses the situation, but is still reeling from the revelation.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00006=I was--
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00007=I... escaped from a base I didn't recognize. Not Dominion... What was that place? Why was I there?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00008=Nova... You've been MIA. You and several other ghosts haven't reported in for months.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00009=So I wasn't on a mission. And this isn't a debriefing. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00010=No, it's not. We have evidence that links you to a terrorist group known as the Defenders of Man. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00011=You're wanted for treason against the Terran Dominion.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00012=Treason? I've always been loyal to the Dominion. You know that.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00013=It's not my call. Valerian will have a lot of questions for you when he arrives.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00015=Look. I believe you, Nova. You're not the type to go AWOL. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00018=Thank you for escorting her down to this base. I want to keep things quiet.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00023=Admiral Horner, zerg forces are heading for our location!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_020/Line00024=All hands to battle stations!

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00005=The news report is playing on the communicator. VALERIAN shuts it off as his guards escort NOVA into the room. She is wary about this situation. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00006=Valerian turns toward her.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00007=Reigel hands Nova a small circular device.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00008=Valerian isn't sure whether this is a criticism or a statement. A beat while he processes it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00009=He moves to the windows, bringing up the screens to reveal her ship.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00010=She considers for a moment.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00013=The guards step back, allowing Nova and Valerian relative privacy. Nova is a little relieved at this.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00014=She attaches it to the neural inhibitor on the back of her neck. A wave of pain hits and Nova flinches, then grits her teeth to get through it. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00015=Reigel and Valerian exchange a look. Nova picks up on it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Comment00016=Nova removes the device and sets it down, relieved but a little weary. She looks at Valerian.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00002=They claim that more zerg attacks are imminent, and Emperor Valerian has refused to take necessary action to protect civilians.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00003=General Davis has supported the Emperor, while Magistrate Grayson says this could mean the worst for Valerian's regime--
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00010=And your rule.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00011=I am not the man my father was. I wish to serve a greater good... I think we have that much in common.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00013=You have it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00014=I was hoping you'd say that. Reigel?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00015=Your new weapons and technology specialist. He has something for you.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00018=I'll be fine.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00019=It's not working. I just keep seeing the city where I grew up.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00020=But it's destroyed--covered in creep. I shouldn't remember it that way. I never went back after the zerg attacked.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00021=Hm, or perhaps you did.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00022=Why would the Defenders of Man operate out of Tarsonis?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00024=Nova... I'm glad to see you made it here safely.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00025=The Defenders of Man didn't make it easy.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00026=No... not for either of us. Yet, if we work together, I believe we can stop them--before they tear apart the Dominion.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00027=This ship is at your disposal, along with my covert ops crew. You will lead them--all I ask in return is your loyalty.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00028=Our scans show that your memories have been altered. But it may still be possible to recover them.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00029=This device sends an electric pulse through your neural inhibitor. The process is unpleasant, but it can restore recent memories.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00030=A good question. Go there, and find the answer.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_030/Line00032=A good question. Go there, and find out.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_040/Comment00014=He hits a button and a new planet appears on one of the central screens.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_040/Comment00016=He closes out comms, and Nova kills him. He slumps over on the desk.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP01_040/Comment00017=She walks up to the monitors, reading them with increasing concern. The Defenders' power and coordination was beyond anything they expected.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00007=Nova continues down the hall, pausing at the door to the bridge. She furrows her brow. Something feels off.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00008=She opens the door and...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00009=INT. GRIFFIN'S BRIDGE
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00010=Nova steps in to the room. She sees Reigel in front of the monitor. The pilots are absent. Reigel turns to face her.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00011=Movement from the stairs catches Nova's eye. Time slows down as she sees a tall figure in black armor crest the top of the stairs and enter her view.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00012=It's Alarak. Nova's blood turns to ice. For a moment she stares, stunned at his presence on her ship, as Alarak steps onto the platform and approaches her. Then she springs into action.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00013=While their eyes are averted, Alarak surreptitiously places his hand on one of the ship's consoles. The UI flickers. He's clearly done something to the ship on the sly -- but Nova and Reigel didn't see it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00014=Nova starts to raise her rifle, but Reigel catches it with his cybernetic hand. Servos strain against Nova's strength. She glares at him; he shakes his head no. Alarak looks on, mildly amused.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00015=He gives her a "what else are we supposed to do?" look and steps aside. Alarak examines her like she's an exhibit at the zoo.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00016=Nova glances at Reigel. What did he just say?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00017=Alarak saunters around the bridge, examining its terran technology with unmasked disdain.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00018=Alarak turns to face Nova.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00019=Nova takes a beat to process this information, then scowls. She's still not entirely convinced she can trust Alarak.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00020=That last statement catches Alarak's attention. He focuses on her, psionically gleaning info from her mind. Nova realizes what he's doing, but she's too late to shield her thoughts.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00021=He approaches her again, gears turning, calculating.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00022=On Nova's reaction, alarmed but subdued.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00023=On Nova, grappling with the decision. Trusting Alarak, using terrazine... is it worth all of the risk, to bring down the Defenders of Man?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00024=She turns her attention back to the newscast, now muted. Davis's portrait is juxtaposed with footage of the destruction on Tyrador IX -- the Defenders' handiwork.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Comment00025=Nova shares a grim look with Reigel. He's on board. She clenches her fist and makes her decision.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00003=This is a terrible tragedy, Kate. My heart goes out to all its victims. The Dominion must protect them. Now, as for the protoss...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00004=Nova. We have a guest--
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00005=Ahem. May I introduce Alarak, Highlord of the Tal'darim.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00006=Hmph. For creatures with such short life spans, you terrans are always so eager to die. 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00007=What do you want?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00009=The same as you...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00011=They destroyed a remote Tal'darim outpost, and then scurried away before the death fleet could retaliate.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00013=And you will find them for me. From what I understand, that's your area of expertise.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00014=If I knew where they were hiding, I'd already be there. But I can't remember anything.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00015=So you were once one of them. Well, you may be more useful than I anticipated.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00016=I suppose you've already attempted to restore your memories. Terran minds are so malleable. What you require... is terrazine.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00017=Terrazine? I don't even have access to it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00018=But I do. I will lead you to its source, in exchange for you taking me to the Defenders of Man. Do we have a bargain?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00019=We do... 
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00021=Tensions run high in the wake of the battle. It is unclear whether the protoss meant to eliminate the zerg, or us as well.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00022=...to annihilate the Defenders of Man.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_020/Line00023=For now.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00003=Nova and Reigel are standing in front of a communicator, in the middle of a conversation with Emperor Valerian, who is in his palace on Korhal.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00004=She raises the vial of refined terrazine into view. Valerian is alarmed.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00005=On the communicator feed, Horner enters the frame and motions to Valerian.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00006=The communicator shuts off and Nova turns to Reigel.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00007=She sits down and Reigel connects the vial to the neural inhibitor port on the back of her neck.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00008=His voice trails off, dreamlike, as Nova's eyes close. She twitches, seeing bursts of her previous escape from the Defenders of Man, almost like rewinding a tape.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00010=Gradually, the memories slow down. Nova is now reliving the events that took place before her last mission for the Defenders of Man.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00011=Nova is in their facility, but it is brighter and more relaxed. She is lying in the chair. The robot camera observes her, then shifts over to the side passively, shutting off.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00012=The Wrangler enters from the side of the frame. His headgear slides up to reveal a smiling face.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00013=They shake hands. It's clear they've been working together for some time.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Comment00014=A Defenders of Man Trooper enters and hands Nova her gear. She is ready to go.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00001=Nova, your findings are compelling, but I can't take action against the Defenders of Man until we know who is leading them.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00002=I agree. That's why I have this.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00003=You've seen what terrazine does to people. No one should use it.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00004=And yet... there is nothing more effective for memory restoration.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00006=The protests are intensifying. You need to evacuate immediately.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00007=So be it. I will not have violence outside the palace. Nova, report back soon... and be careful.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00008=Seems like he could take his own advice...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00009=Oh, he won't. But as for the terrazine, I can make the process safer by administering it to you in microdoses.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00010=It will take longer to restore all of your memories, but the chances of a psychotic episode are greatly reduced.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00011=You've convinced me. Let's get started.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00012=Try to remember everything you see...

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00014=Thanks. It'll be a challenge, but working for the Dominion always is...

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00018=I remember the location of my last mission for the Defenders of Man. It's not much, but it might lead to something more...
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00019=Are you all right?
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00020=I agree. And that's why I have this.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00022=He's right. It's the only option we have.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00023=No psychotic episodes? You've convinced me. Let's get started.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00024=Thanks. The Defenders of Man have already done so much for the Dominion. I'm glad I was sent here to help out.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_030/Line00025=The admiral wasn't lying when he said we'd be working with the best soldiers under his command.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00013=Your family, not you. As long as she's out there, more civilians will die. I can't let her live.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP02_040/Line00014=No. People are calling for me to step down, and I will not see her become a martyr. I need to handle this the right way.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00003=Her desk is plain and utilitarian aside from a photo of her with Arcturus during the early days of the Sons of Korhal rebellion, when they were young idealists.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00004=The camera angle shifts, revealing that Davis has been looking at plans for the Defenders' psi-emitters. A recorded Adjutant's voice narrates the more compelling features of the emitters.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00006=Davis' expression hardens as she hears Valerian's name. She brings up a file on the emperor's involvement in his father's death, and plays a recording of his transmission to Kerrigan.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_010/Comment00007=Davis seethes. Valerian has killed his own father, and is unsuited to rule in his stead, in her view.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00006=But then... the people become restless. We hear the sound of ships approaching. It's the protoss!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00007=Tal'darim vessels blast over the crowd, followed by the immense shadow of a looming mothership. Alarak's forces have arrived!
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00008=Valerian is interrupted by Alarak, who contacts the crowd telepathically. He winces, with Horner, Davis, Nova, and the marines also reacting behind him.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00009=Valerian is shocked. Davis looks on with disapproval.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Comment00010=The camera moves past her to focus on Nova, who takes a few steps backwards as Alarak's speaks to her alone.

Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00004=I take these allegations seriously.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00005=The truth is they used psi-emitters to incite the feral zerg to attack, and they have executed unprovoked strikes on the protoss as well.
Conversation/SMX3_Cutscene_MP03_020/Line00006=Our evidence is undeniable. The orders we recovered were issued by none other than General Carolina Davis.

VoiceOver/Scientist/Attack01=Who? Me? Are you sure?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Attack02=Shouldn't a trooper be doing this?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Attack03=But I'm a man of science!
VoiceOver/Scientist/Attack04=Perhaps someone with a gun would do better?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Attack05=There's no logic behind this!

VoiceOver/Scientist/Help01=Why are they attacking me?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed00=Is this how you address a superior officer?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed01=I'm willing to overlook it. But just this once.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed02=Oh, fine... Twice.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed03=(Ahem)Three times...
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed04=(sigh)Well, at least you seem to understand the principles of thorough scientific testing.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed05=You do know what the definition of insanity is, right?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed06=I am this close to filing a formal complaint to administration!
VoiceOver/Scientist/Pissed07=Huh? Yes, I suppose that would be a poor idea. What are we doing? Shouldn't I return to my research?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Ready00=Humanity must advance!
VoiceOver/Scientist/Ready01=True science requires courage!
VoiceOver/Scientist/What00=Yes?
VoiceOver/Scientist/What01=Oh, I just had an idea!
VoiceOver/Scientist/What02=What if... no.
VoiceOver/Scientist/What03=This had best be important.
VoiceOver/Scientist/What04=What is it you need?
VoiceOver/Scientist/What05=Science department, responding.
VoiceOver/Scientist/What06=Hm?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes00=Ready to proceed.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes01=A curious proposal.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes02=(sigh)Let's get this over with.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes03=Yes, I see.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes04=Are you certain?
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes05=I'll be there shortly.
VoiceOver/Scientist/Yes06=Right, right.

VoiceOver/Trooper/Death03=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/Trooper/Death04=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/Trooper/Death05=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/Trooper/Death06=<END - do not translate>
VoiceOver/Trooper/Help00=Taking fire!
VoiceOver/Trooper/Help01=Engaging hostiles!
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed00=Command, is your voice... uh, different? Huh? Oh, you're right... it's nothing.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed01=Yeah, I'm a little short to be a trooper. But... just--just a little.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed02=The masks use to cover our entire face, you know... Personally, I blame budget cutbacks.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed03=For the Defenders of Man, we seem to do an awful lot of attacking. Eh, I'm sure that's not confusing.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed04=The best part of these goggles is binge watching holo-vids while the bosses think you're on patrol.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Pissed05=Look, I need to be getting back to my route.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Ready00=Safeguarding the future.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Ready01=Some will die so that others may live.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What00=Yes, command?
VoiceOver/Trooper/What01=Hm. Comm's a little fuzzy.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What02=Awaiting orders.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What03=You've got my attention.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What04=10-2, receiving.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What05=Ready to serve.
VoiceOver/Trooper/What06=Trooper, standing by.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Yes00=With vigilance.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Yes01=Eyes open.
VoiceOver/Trooper/Yes02=Moving out.

VoiceOver/Trooper/Yes07=On patrol.
