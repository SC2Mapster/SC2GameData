Conversation/CreepVO/Line00198=Now you shall know my wrath.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00202=Enough to buy me services, for now! Load the cannons!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00207=Arr! The pact be sealed. Let's knock these boys down a peg or two.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00234= Word is there's treasure on the docks... Be quick and grab it!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00235=That's enough! We don't be working for free!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00236=Well then... Who's got the coin for me services? <dark chuckle>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00237=Arg! Arg! What? It's fun to say.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00248=Well, ye landlubbers! Here, everyone pays the respects to the captain. And this captain only respects one thing: coin! Haha!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00249=Don't care how ye bucko's get 'em.

Conversation/CreepVO/Line00254=Know this realm is under MY protection. It bends to MY every whim.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00255=If you desire victory, you will gather tribute in my name.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00256=Be the first and receive my blessing.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00257=Your enemies will fall... Their every defense disabled and weakened.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00258=But you had better press your advantage. My favor is not eternal. Hahaha.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00259=What do you say? Are you ready to begin?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00260=You dare come to Cursed Hollow? <laugh> Amusing.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00261=The mines will open shortly, heroes... soon the undead will awaken.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00262=Death stirs within the mines... Shall you brave the darkness?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00263=Are you prepared to fight the undead? The mines shall open shortly.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00264=The dead rise again, heroes. Dare you enter the mines?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00265=There's no turning back now...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00266=Enter heroes, the damned await.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00267=Do you hear that clattering? (darkly) I believe they're hungry...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00268=Rise golems! Rise and let loose your wrath!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00269=Let my golems rise again!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00270=Now is the hour of my golems' return.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00271=Well done, your golem is stronger than your enemies.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00272=Your golem is complete... but it is weaker than that of your foes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00273=It seems both golems are of similar strength.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00274=The golems return... Yours is far more powerful.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00275=Well done. Your golem is much stronger than your foe's.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00276=The golems rise... But be wary, yours is far weaker than your foe's.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00277=You will need to gather more skulls than that, if you wish a stronger golem.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00278=The golems have revived. Both golems are of similar strength.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00279=Hmm. It seems both golems are nearly equal in power.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00280=My golems return... This should be amusing.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00281=Unleash your boundless anger!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00282=Hold on, things are about to get grave.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00283=<Dark laughter>
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00284=Oh good, the main attraction is about to begin.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00285=Well, this should be downright ghoulish.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00286=Welcome, foolish heroes... to the Haunted Mines. Here, death reigns eternal...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00287=Soon the mines will open... and the terrors within shall awaken.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00288=<laugh> Perhaps, you and I can make a pact that benefits us both.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00289=Slay the undead. Wrest their cursed skulls from them.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00290=In turn, I will summon forth my mighty bone golems.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00291=They will destroy your enemy's defenses. So... do we have deal?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00292=The ancient shrines awaken. Control them and let loose the Dragon Knight!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00293=The shrines are gathering power. The Dragon Knight calls from within the stone.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00294=Soon the shrines shall awaken, heroes...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00295=Power gathers within the shrines. Unleash the dragon's wrath!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00296=Hurry, activate the shrines and the Dragon's power is yours.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00297=The dragon shall rest no longer... Unleash its power!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00298=Activate the shrines. Take the Dragon Knight's power!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00299=Free the Dragon Knight, and slaughter your enemies!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00300=It is time! Release the Dragon Knight!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00301=The Dragon's power is yours, heroes!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00302=Devastate your enemies!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00303=Your enemy controls the shrines, heroes...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00304=Now you shall face the Dragon's wrath.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00305=Your time grows short, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00306=Let your enemies burn!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00307=Your foes shall be ash!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00308=I live again!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00309=You shall burn.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00310=The flame cleanses all.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00311=I shall reduce you to cinder. 
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00312=I shall not return to that prison! No!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00313=No... I am not finished!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00314=The dragons shall rule again!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00315=The Dragons claim this realm!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00316=The Gardens of Dragon Shire... Radiant, are they not? And yet they are founded on a lie...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00317=The people have forgotten my lineage, that this realm was once ruled by Dragons.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00318=Activate the sun and the moon shrines, and the magic that seals away my Dragon Knight will weaken.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00319=I shall lend you its power. Burn your enemies. Shatter their fortifcations. Remind this world of its true heritage.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00320=The Dragon will be reborn. Control its power, or be destroyed by it... Your choice.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00321=Your golem is weaker than your foe's. Prepare your defenses.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00322=Your golems are of similar strength. Prepare yourselves.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00323=The spawning is complete. Your golem outpowers your foe's.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00324=Your golem is stronger than your foes. Make the most of it.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00325=A weak golem. Gather more skulls, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00326=It is done. Your golem is equal to that of your foes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00327=Break free and destroy your enemies!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00328=Slay the undead and claim their skulls, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00329=Gather skulls and empower your golem!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00330=The damned shall soon return. Prepare yourselves, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00331=Listen, heroes... The undead shall rise within the mines shortly.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00332=Rise again, my golems, and unleash your boundless anger!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00333=The shrines awaken once more. Who will control the Dragon Knight's power?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00334=The Dragon awaits, heroes! Free him, and destroy your enemy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00335=The time has come! Unleash the Dragon's power!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00336=The end is nigh, the Dragon shall be reborn by your enemy's hands.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00337=Your enemy shall fall!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00338=The fire comes for you!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00339=Time is... fleeting...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00340=Heroes, night will fall in just a few moments... I hope you're ready.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00341=Night falls, heroes. How I love to see my garden in the moon's glow.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00342=Night falls once more, and soon the shamblers shall rise again.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00343=The night comes, heroes. Remember: kill the shamblers and claim their seeds.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00344=Night falls in 30 seconds. Are you ready for some amusement?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00345=The shamblers rise! Slay them... Claim their seeds.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00346=The shamblers rise... Slay them and gather the seeds.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00347=It is time... Do what must be done.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00348=The shamblers rise again. Free my seeds, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00349=Slaughter them all. Take back my seeds!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00350=Dawn's light... hurry heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00351=Dawn breaks... Our time is almost over.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00352=The light. Daylight comes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00353=<angry exertion> The wretched sun... Reclaim my seeds, now...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00358=You have enough seeds. Bring them... I will improve your weak flesh...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00359=Finally, you have enough seeds. Come... become the pride of my garden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00360=Bring those seeds to my soil... and drink your enemy's terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00361=Plant the seeds, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00362=Come and plant the seeds. Now.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00363=Do not test me. Plant the seeds... use my power.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00364=Come to the fertile soil... plant the seeds.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00365=Plant the seeds, meat creatures.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00366=Your terror lives! Go! Harvest your enemy's corpses.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00367=Excellent. March forth. Uproot your enemy's forts.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00368=Rise, my terror! Sap the life from your enemies!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00369=Your enemy spawns a terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00370=Your enemy's terror blooms.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00371=A terror grows for your enemies.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00372=Your terror has come to life.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00373=Finally, your terror lives.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00374=Your terror blooms. Pray it is stronger than your enemy's.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00375=Your enemy has spawned a terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00376=Your enemy now has a terror of their own!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00377=Heroes, your enemy has spawned a terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00378=No, my beautiful terror has fallen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00379=Your terror has fallen. You are but meat and flesh once more.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00380=Your terror, my child, has fallen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00381=Your enemy's terror is compost.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00382=The enemy's terror has fallen.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00383=The enemy's terror is but a husk.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00384=Your terror has fallen, but your enemy's lives.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00385=The enemy's terror lives.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00386=Now you are on your own.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00387=No one can stop you. Destroy them!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00388=Yes... Guide my terror. Slay them all.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00389=Their terror falls. Go... Harvest their corpses.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00394=You've collected enough seeds! Plant them, and the seedlings will improve your weak flesh...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00395=Finally, you have enough seeds. Plant them here, and become the pride of my garden.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00396=Well done, heroes. Bring those seeds here, and you will drink from your enemy's terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00397=A terror has bloomed!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00398=A terror has come to life.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00399=A terror has bloomed!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00400=A terror has come to life.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00401=<yawn> The sun dawns... My children must sleep, for now.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00402=I see you've survived another night. How wonderful for you.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00403=<Yawn> The dawn has come, heroes, and with it my children must rest.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00404=It's over for now... But don't get too comfortable. The infested will return again.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00405=Ah, heroes. <laugh> You've arrived just in time to witness my gardens come alive.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00406=At night, we transform... the Garden of Terror blossoms.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00407=Slay the mindless shamblers and take their seeds.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00408=When you have enough, I shall grant you the power of nature.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00409=Trample your foes... choke the life from them... improve their hideous flesh.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00411=Come and plant the seeds of your enemy's destruction.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00412=You should plant those seeds. Now.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00413=What are you waiting for? You have the seeds... plant them.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00414=Head to the soil and plant your seeds, quickly.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00415=Plant the seeds... It may be daylight, but I can still grant you power.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00416=There! Your terror has come to life! Use it to harvest your enemy's corpses.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00417=Well done! The terror shall uproot your enemy's forts!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00418=Nicely done. The terror shall sap the life from your enemy.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00419=Your enemy has spawned a terror. Interesting.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00420=I hate to say it, but your enemy has spawned a terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00421=A terror has grown for your enemies, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00422=Your terror has come to life. Isn't it lovely?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00423=That terror should come in handy right about now, I'd think.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00424=Your terror has spawned. I wonder if it's stronger than your enemy's?
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00425=Heroes, your enemy has also spawned a terror!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00426=Uh oh. It seems your enemy now has a terror of their own!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00427=Your enemy has spawned a terror, heroes!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00428=Your terror has wilted.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00429=Your terror is compost.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00430=Your terror has been cut down.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00431=Well done! Your enemy's terror has withered away.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00432=You've destroyed the enemy's terror.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00433=Excellent, your enemy's terror is but a husk.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00434=Your terror has fallen, but your enemy's lives, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00435=Heroes, the enemy's terror still lives!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00436=I hope you can stop your enemy without my terror...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00437=Your enemy's terror has fallen! Press onward, heroes!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00438=You've destroyed their terror! You're starting to impress me, heroes.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00439=Their terror has been cut down! Keep up the harvest, heroes!
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00440=What a joyous night... to have a curse.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00441=But we require change... pollination.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00442=Spread my infestation. The Spore Queen demands it...
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00443=Finally, you have enough seeds. The Terror grows once more.
Conversation/CreepVO/Line00444=You've collected enough seeds! And I see your terror is growing nicely.

Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00012=This stormgate will bring us to Raven Court, one of the many realms of the Nexus. Click to move there now.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00013=Hey, this ain't my first rodeo, Uther. I know how to walk...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00014=I do not doubt you friend, but things are different here, it is best to learn that now!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00015=An enemy minion already? We just got here... Bah, press the "A" key, then left-click it to attack.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00016=An enemy minion already? We just got here... Bah, press the "A" key, then right-click it to attack.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00017=An enemy minion already? We just got here... Bah, press the attack key, then click it to attack.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00018=Let's press forward. The minions ahead can be seen here on your minimap.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00019=You plan on lending a hand here, Uther?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00020=I've already completed my tutorial, lad. You've got to do your own. Besides, I think you can handle a few minions.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00021=Did some kind of glowy orb just bust out of that thing?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00022=A regeneration globe. Move to it and it will regenerate health and mana for both you and nearby allies.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00023=Oh, I can feel my health returning!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00024=That was a regeneration globe. It regenerates health and mana for both you and any allies nearby.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00025=You can press the "A" key and left-click the ground to move towards a location and attack enemies you encounter along the way.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00026=You can press the "A" key and right-click the ground to move towards a location and attack enemies you encounter along the way.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00027=You can press the attack key and click the ground to move towards a location and attack enemies you encounter along the way.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00028=Nicely done. Looks like we've made it to town.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00029=Just hold your horses... Before I go into someplace new, you gotta tell me what I'm getting into... Now, what exactly is this Nexus place?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00030=The Nexus is a cosmic storm where worlds collide from across time, space and even dimension.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00031=More and more of us are being called into this enigmatic realm, tested in the forge of combat against others of equal merit.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00032=So, I'm here to fight things.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00033=And achieve glory.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00034=Okay. That's simple enough for me... Let's go.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00035=Diablo?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00036=You dare stand against the Lord of Terror?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00037=(chuckle) I wonder... How tastes your fear, mortal?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00038=I wouldn't know. I'm not even sure you can actually taste fear...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00039=(Roar) You will be devoured!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00040=Well, he doesn't make the best first impression, does he? Think I better teach him some manners. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00041=You wanna clue me in on what's going on here?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00042=This realm is known as Raven Court... and it appears to be under siege by the Demon Lord Diablo.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00043=Abilities appear on the action bar at the bottom of your screen.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00044=If you're going to take on Diablo you'll need to make the most of your abilities.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00045=First, try out your penetrating round against Diablo's undead soldiers.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00046=First, try out your penetrating round against Diablo's minions.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00047=Patience, lad. Aim carefully and try again.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00048=Press the Q key, then aim your targeting arrow over the skeletons. Once you're ready, left-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00049=Press the Q key, then aim your targeting arrow over the skeletons. Once you're ready, right-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00050=Activate your Penetrating Round ability, then aim your targeting arrow over the skeletons. Once you're ready, click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00051=Right-clicking cancels an ability. When the targeting arrow is active, use left-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00052=Left-clicking cancels an ability. When the targeting arrow is active, use right-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00053=Press the Q key, then aim your targeting arrow over the enemies. Once you're ready, left-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00054=Press the Q key, then aim your targeting arrow over the enemies. Once you're ready, right-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00055=Activate Penetrating Round, then aim your targeting arrow over the enemies. Once you're ready, click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00056=Once you've pressed the Q key, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies and then left-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00057=Once you've pressed the Q key, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies and then right-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00058=Once you've activated Penetrating Round, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies then click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00059=Press the Q key, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies and then left-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00060=Press the Q key, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies and then right-click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00061=Activate Penetrating Round, aim your targeting arrow over the enemies, then click to fire.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00062=That's it! Using your abilities will deal more damage than your basic weapon attacks.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00063=There are more skeletons up ahead. Use your penetrating round to defeat them.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00064=There are more minions up ahead. Use your penetrating round to defeat them.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00065=Nice shot, lad!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00066=I suggest you try it sometime, Uther. It's a lot more effective than hitting things with that dang hammer.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00067=Remember: you can use penetrating round to kill groups of minions all at once.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00068=There's too many skeletons ahead... we've got to retreat.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00069=Well, this ain't good. These boys are losing the will to fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00070=Your inspire ability emboldens both your allies and yourself.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00071=You must inspire these footmen and continue the fight!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00072=Feels like I can take on the world! Charge!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00073=Don't get cocky, kid...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00074=Your inspire ability increases the attack speed of both you and nearby allies. Use it whenever you can.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00075=Your inspire ability empowers both you and nearby allies. Use it whenever you can.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00076=Remember: your penetrating round can kill groups of skeletons while your minions fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00077=Inspiring your minions will help you defeat the skeletons more efficiently.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00078=Your newfound bravery will not save you. Your petty lives end here.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00079=Our footmen are engaging Diablo up ahead. Unlock your camera and take a look.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00080=That's it. Now scroll the map and let's see what Diablo is up to.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00081=Burn in hellfire!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00082=He's injured! Now's your time to strike!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00083=You can press your spacebar to return the camera to your hero at any time.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00084=Return the camera to your hero, and let's get going!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00085=If you prefer, you can return to a locked camera by pressing the "L" key once more.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00086=If you prefer, you can always return to a locked camera.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00087=This realm and all the misbegotten souls within it are mine!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00088=Not on my watch.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00089=Diablo plays rough. Use Penetrating Round to knock him away.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00090=I will hunt your soul across eternity, James Raynor.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00091=Well done, lad! But this is not over yet.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00092=Use your hearthstone to join me. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00093=Stand still while the hearthstone's magic does it's work.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00094=(whistles) Now ain't this fancy...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00095=This is the Hall of Storms. Heroes are summoned here when a battle begins.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00096=Our goal is to destroy the enemy's core while protecting our own from their attacks.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00097=Both cores summon minions which travel down this pathway and fight each other in countless waves of combat.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00098=Gotcha. Take out Diablo's core and this fight's over... Sounds easy enough. But tell me, why are we doing this again?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00099=(frustrated sigh) You know... (beat) You really shouldn't think so hard about these things...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00100=First, head out to the front line.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00101=Stitches want to play!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00102=Not very wise, that one... Attacking a fort by yourself is practically suicide.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00103=Our minions will help you press towards the enemy core. Stay behind them and let them soak up damage.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00104=Careful! Only attack towers when they are busy fighting others.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00105=Well done, lad! You have proven yourself worthy. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00106=What can I say? I've got a talent for making things explode.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00107=Minions and stone are no challenge! Now I will feast upon your terror!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00108="Feast upon my terror?" Now that's twice, man... Now let me school you. You cannot eat fear or terror.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00109=Mmhmm! He right. No taste terror.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00110=You see? Stinky here gets it.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00111=<Frustrated Roar> Enough!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00112=Wait a minute. Didn't I just die?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00113=Don't worry, within the Nexus death is merely a setback. After a short break, you'll be revived and ready to fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00114=I hope you don't mind if I join you this time. That should even the scales a bit.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00115=Not at all... Let's giddy-up, partner!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00116=Mount up and let's head back into the fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00117=If you mount up, we can get back to the front line faster.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00118=You can dismount by pressing the mount button again.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00119=Be careful. I won't always be there to save you.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00120=Careful, lad. I saved you again.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00121=Pick up globes to regenerate health and mana.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00122=Enemy towers are quite deadly, but they'll always attack minions before firing on a hero.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00123=Only assault a tower when our minions are nearby.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00124=Escape quickly! We will return when we have minions to guard us!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00125=Stay behind our minions and let them soak up damage.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00126=Don't forget to use Penetrating Round and Inspire to deal with your enemies more efficiently.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00127=If you forget a command, it can be found listed here in the upper-left.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00128=That's it! All that remains is the enemy's core!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00129=Hey, you got anything more to say, fire breath?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00130=(Roar) I will have my vengeance, James Raynor. This is not over!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00131=Well, this ain't a fair fight!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00132=You shall not stand alone!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00133=Well, look what the Nexus dragged in... Fancy seeing you here, cowboy. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00134=Nova? Now, this place is startin' to feel like home. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00135=Don't get comfortable... you're in for a bumpy ride. 
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00136=Haha. Only kind I ever liked...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00137=Now c'mon Red, let's see what you got! I'm ready for round two.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00138=<Roar>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00139=I hope you're ready, Raynor. This is as real as it gets!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00140=I was born ready, Uther...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00141=Remember, if you're injured you can return here to our Hall of Storms, and your wounds will heal automatically over time.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00142=As before, our goal is to fight the enemy team and destroy their core.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00143=Now the way I see it; there are three lanes to the enemy's base. We better make sure someone's covering each one.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00144=Now you've got it, lad. Once the battle starts, follow me and get ready to fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00145=Whenever you kill enemy minions, heroes or structures, our team gains experience.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00146=We gain experience together, and everything you do contributes to our team's success.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00147=The experience and current level of both teams is shown here.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00148=Once the blue bar fills entirely our team levels up and we each grow stronger.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00149=Let's go get us a level then.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00150=Well done, we've leveled up!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00151=Your stats have increased and your abilities have becomes stronger.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00152=That sounds mighty helpful. You got anything else fun for me?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00153=Leveling also unlocks talents, that let you customize your abilities and change the way you fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00154=Hey, not bad! Already feelin' stronger.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00155=You've unlocked your heroic ability, an incredibly powerful skill that turns the tide of battle. Just be careful when you use it.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00156=Heroic ability, huh? Can't wait to try that out.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00157=Dang. Not feeling so good.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00158=Better head to a healing fountain. You can right-click it to regain health.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00159=Better head to a healing fountain. You can left-click it to regain health.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00160=Better head to a healing fountain. You can click it to regain health.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00161=There you go. After drinking from a fountain, your health and mana will regenerate over time.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00162=But you'll have to wait until the fountain refills, before you can drink from it again.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00163=Raynor, retreat now!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00164=I've got to pull back.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00165=Raynor, we could use your help over here. We're going to "encourage" a few of these siege giants to join our side.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00166=Encourage?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00167=Oh, it's more fun than it sounds. Just, trust me... <reload sound>
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00168=Stand within that beacon for a moment would you?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00169=There we are. Once a mercenary camp is defeated they'll join us in battle attacking down the nearest lane.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00170=Alright, I say we escort these siege critters to the enemy's fort and bust that dang thing apart.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00171=Siege giants are quite effective at destroying forts from long range.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00172=Raynor, we could use some back up. Try taking a mercenary camp by yourself.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00173=Don't forget to use your abilities to defeat them.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00174=Well...Those rocks are pretty slow. I bet I can dodge 'em.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00175=Raynor, head over to that watch tower. If you can secure it, it will grant us vision of that area.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00176=Stay there for a bit and the watchtower will activate.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00177=Pull back, lad. It's dangerous to attack a tower without our minions.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00178=Be careful, there are no minions to protect you from that tower.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00179=Hurry up, lad. We need your help with these siege giants.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00180=Guess I better go help Uther before the old man gets cranky...er.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00181=Raynor, I could use your assistance in this lane.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00182=Note to self: remember to use these abilities more often.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00183=Your health is running low, you should use a healing fountain.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00184=You're out of mana. Drink from a healing fountain, or use your hearthstone to return to base and your health and mana will replenish over time.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00185=Might be worth taking a merc camp, right now.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00186=Out of health, and the fountain's dry. I better use this hearthstone and heal up at our base.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00187=Mount up, and you can get back to the front-line faster.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00188=If you mount up, you'll be able to move much faster. The default hotkey for your mount is: Z.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00189=No time for sitting around, Marshall. Pick a lane and get ready to fight.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00190=Thank goodness, a regeneration globe! I sure need that.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00191=Don't forget to choose a talent, lad.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00192=The enemy has taken our watch tower. If we can, we should take it back.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00193=A penetrating round would kill this group of enemies mighty quick.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00194=Raynor, use your inspire ability to strengthen our attacks!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00195=Right-clicking cancels an ability. When trying to use an ability use left-click to activate it.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00196=Left-clicking cancels an ability. When trying to use an ability use right-click to activate it.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00197=You've just canceled an ability. Make sure you're using correct mouse button to fire Penetrating Round.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00198=Right-clicking cancels an ability. Use left-click to summon the Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00199=Left-clicking cancels an ability. Use right-click to summon the Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00200=You've just canceled an ability. Make sure you're using the correct mouse button to summon the Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00201=When your health is low, heal yourself by drinking from a healing fountain. Or you can hearth back to our base and heal over time.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00202=Don't be hasty. Getting yourself killed by charging in at low health grants our enemies experience and leaves us a man short.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00203=Use your hearthstone to return to our core, but make sure you're either far from our enemies or hidden when you hearth away.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00204=Hey! You interrupted my hearthstone!
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00205=It takes a while to use a hearthstone and it can be interrupted by enemy attacks. Only use it when in safe areas.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00206=I'd say this looks like the perfect time to call down the Hyperion.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00207=I bet if I call down the Hyperion now, we could take out these guys.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00208=So, what're you supposed to be? Some kind of knight?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00209=Paladin, actually.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00210=That's just splittin' hairs isn't it?
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00211=No, you see, a paladin wields the power of--
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00212=Let me stop you right there, buddy. I don't need to really know...
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00213=You sure are a sight for sore eyes, Nova.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00214=Wish I could say the same about you, cowboy.
Conversation/ObsoleteTutorialVO/Line00215=Hey, Diablo... <lipsmack> Think I'm starting to taste YOUR fear...
Conversation/OverwatchEventVO/Comment00001=END
Conversation/OverwatchEventVO/Group00001=Event Start
Conversation/OverwatchEventVO/Group00002=Event End

Conversation/OverwatchEventVO/Line00003=Loot crates have ceased spawning.
Conversation/Spooky18/Group00001=Spooky Raven Lord
Conversation/Spooky18/Group00002=Spooky Lady of Thorns
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00001=Generals, go forth and slaughter in my name. The Raven Lord demands it.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00002=Kingscrest will fall. Let this serve as a lesson to all who oppose the Raven Lord.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00003=The might of the Raven Lord descends upon on this pitiful kingdom.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00004=Phantom Knight Zarya, cleanse this realm in unholy flame.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00005=You believe you can face my generals? Oh please. <laughter>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00006=Who has dared to strike down my phantom knight? Oh, it's you. I should have expected this.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00007=I see, one of my generals has fallen. What vexing gnats you are.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00008=The Spectral Wyrm Alexstrasza, aspect of undeath, stands against you.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00009=Aspect of Undeath, the Raven Lord calls upon you to serve!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00010=<angry exertion> How did you kill that which has no life?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00011=The spectral wyrm has fallen? <scoff> This is not over.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00012=Witch of the Hollows, the time has come to punish this realm!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00013=Kingscrest will be punished for its interference.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00014=A curse upon you interlopers.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00015=Why won't you die?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00016=Spider Warden, I have found new prey for you.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00017=Hunt down my enemies, general. And do so, ruthlessly.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00018=The hunt is over, but the war is not.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00019=So... you have slain your pursuer... (sigh) I grow tired of this charade.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00020=Were you expecting this to reach its conclusion so easily? 
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00021=So, you have bested my generals. Very well. Let's see how you handle the Dragon Knight.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00022=Enjoy your paltry victory, heroes. For Kingscrest is no more.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00023=You have won, heroes. The grand champions of a dying realm. <laugh>
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00024=You think you're clever... don't you?
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00025=A relic of the past...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00026=Hmph. Enjoy that useless relic.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00027=What a waste of effort.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00031=I've had enough of this.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00032=How dare you defy the Raven Lord.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00033=No...
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00034=You have lost my favor <beat> to say the least.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00035=You have weakened my forces, true. But no power can halt my wrath now.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00036=Kingscrest will fall this night. So says the Raven Lord!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00037=Heroes, take up arms and vanquish the Raven Lord's minions!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00038=Today, the Raven Lord will know defeat. King's Crest shall prevail!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00039=The Raven Lord's evil ends here. I will tolerate his actions no further!
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00040=The Raven Lord's Phantom Knight seeks to burn my realm to ash. Snuff out its unholy fire.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00041=This hollow suit of armor is one of the Raven Lord's generals. It will fall, same as its master.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00042=No mere phantom can stand against a true knight of King's Crest.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00043=Fear not, Raven Lord. You will join your Phantom Knight soon enough.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00044=The Raven Lord dares to attack King's Crest with a dragon? What a fool.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00045=Once a noble creature, the Spectral Wyrm now serves a vile master. Liberate its spirit.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00046=Let this death set free this dragon's soul.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00047=King's Crest is a realm of life. Undeath has no place here.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00048=This will not be over until you lie defeated, Raven Lord.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00049=The Witch of the Hollow made a dark bargain for her power. But it is no match for our steel.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00050=This witch seeks to "punish" us. Show her the true meaning of the word.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00051=Her vile magics will profane my realm no longer.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00052=The curse is broken, Raven Lord. As is your witch.
Conversation/Spooky18/Line00053=The Raven Lord has sent his Spider Warden to prey upon us. We are no one's prey.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed07=You think I'm big? You should see my step-mother.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed08=Ever notice how it's exactly when you get your purple items organized that heroes drop in unexpectedly?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed09=The key to efficient webcrawling is proper distribution.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed10=There is a saying in Azjol-Nerub: In the kingdom of the spiders, the giant carnivorous beetle is the king.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed11=The fued between crypt lords and bloodlords is eternal.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed12=Bugs this big become features.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed13=Don't be a noob. Only I'm allowed to do that. <SFX: cricket chirp> I'm making that sound myself.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Pissed14=Honestly. Ten more minutes of this abuse, and I will go berserk!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected00=Excellent timing.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Resurrected01=Yes, I return!
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeEnd00=A poor display.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeEnd01=You made your choice.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeEnd02=I feed upon your anguish.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeStart00=You shall experience my torment, first-hand.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeStart01=A fatal mistake.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/RevengeStart02=I look forward to snapping your bones one by one.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Revive00=My service is eternal.

VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Perhaps you require a demonstration of my skill?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<frustrated exertion> Is there not a battle to be waged?
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=The Lich King was a suit of armor frozen in ice, and he was still a more active leader than you.
VoiceOver/AnubarakCybarakBase/Ultimate1Used00=Embrace the web of death.

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_OnMyWay00=I shall help.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_OnMyWay01=I will aid you.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat00=We must retreat.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Retreat01=Fall back, warriors!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh00=Alas.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh01=This was not to be.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/AI_Uhoh02=I grieve for you, friend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack00=Vanquish!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack01=Shakal zen! (Translation: Vanquish!)
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack02=Triumph through sacrifice.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack03=En taro Tassadar!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack04=They will meet justice.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Attack05=We fight against the darkness!

VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion01=Have you prepared yourself for this battle?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Alarak00=Highlord Alarak? What a surprise...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Condescending00=I see you are still at an... early stage of evolution.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=I do only what I must.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Fenix00=Fenix!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=What zerg abomination is this?!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Of all the allies I could have, I ended up with you?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=I am pleased to fight alongside a warrior like you.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Raynor00=It is good to fight by your side once more, Friend Raynor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Tassadar00=My mentor... Guide us in the fight ahead.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zeratul00=It brings me great joy to see you, old friend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=I must ally with the zerg? So be it.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond00=I am well versed in the ways of war.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond01=Our foes will regret this day!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroRespond02=We are steadfast in the face of peril.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Alarak00=No different from you, Alarak.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=If you have any wisdom at all, you will remain silent!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Fenix00=We shall show them the might of the Templar!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Really! I will not dignify that with a response.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=I do not need the Khala to know what you think of this.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=The enemy will fall before our onslaught!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Raynor00=Lost in the Nexus and on the verge of battle, but otherwise--acceptable.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Tassadar00=For the glory of Aiur!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zeratul00=Anon por-ghal! (Translation: Time for battle!)
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/IntroResponse_Zerg00=We will settle this after the battle, abomination.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill00=You lack honor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill01=Such a disappointment.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill02=No match for the blades of a templar.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill03=Those who are divided, fall.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Kill04=An inferior lifeform.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillAlarak00=This is a rare satisfaction.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillKerrigan00=That was for Raszagal!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillProtoss00=You should have joined in my unity.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillRaynor00=My apologies for that, Friend Raynor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillSpreeEnd00=Enough of you!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillTassadar00=It seems I have surpassed you, mentor.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZeratul00=May Adun hide you next time.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/KillZerg00=I will purge your kind from this galaxy.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Laugh00=<bemused laugh>
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowHealth00=My health is low.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal00=Just like the astral winds...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal01=Such kindness will be remembered.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowLifeHeal02=Your support is vital, friend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana00=I am low on mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana01=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana02=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/LowMana_Evo00=Low mana.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No01=It is not so.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally needs us.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Stand with me!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AssistMe01=The enemy threatens me.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Attack00=We should attack here.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Destroy our enemy's core!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Let us capture this mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Bring this fort to ruin!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We must seize that tower.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Capture00=Capture this objective!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Capture01=We must capture this, now!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Collect00=We should gather these.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Collect01=Let us collect these.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Danger00=Danger lurks here.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Danger01=Be on your guard.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Defend00=This point could use our defense.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core before all is lost!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Our fort needs more defenses!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Safeguard this structure.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=This structure needs our protection.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Hold this point!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Defend this.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Guard this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Strike at this structure!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Bring this structure down!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=This one must fall.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=We must eliminate this enemy, now.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Hm. A foe has gone.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=What is this? An enemy has vanished.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_KillHero00=Slay this foe, now!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=I am on my way to you.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Our paths shall be one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Retreat00=It is best to retreat for now.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Retreat01=Fall back!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Transport00=Let us move this.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_Transport01=We must move this, quickly.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Head for the turn in point.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ping_TurnIn01=We must turn these in.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed00=Dawn will come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed01=Strength in unity.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed02=This realm poses many questions, and few answers...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed03=Were the xel'naga involved in the creation of the Nexus? If so, they have left no temples... no new lifeforms...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed04=Unless those lifeforms were unseen... controlling us through some sort of complicated digital mechanism. Some sort of battle net as it were...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed05=Maybe even thousands of these lifeforms, all manipulating our lives at once?! Agh... Alright, this is giving me a headache.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed06=I wonder what the Daelaam are doing in my absence. Hopefully they haven't rearranged the furnishings in my council chamber. I hate it when they do that.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed07=So, the Spear of Adun is right above me... yet Phase-smith Karax is nowhere to be found? <sigh> Typical.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed08=Will you stop poking me? Go dispense your aggression on one of the orcs! See how they like it!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed09=By the way, I said StarCraft wasn't just Warcraft in space... Whatever this Heroes of the Storm thing is doesn't count.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed10=Yes, my starship follows me wherever I go. It is like what you terrans refer to as a pet, only useful.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed11=I was only made Hierarch a short time ago, but I'm still thinking about my career advancement. With a little luck, I'll be Highestarch in no time.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed12=What do you think of the new armor? My last one left me feeling a little... exposed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed13=I am only young for a protoss. I have lived two centuries more than most of you, and I would appreciate your respect.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed14=I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each and every star array... And more, much more than this, I did it my way.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed_Evo00=Dawn come...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Pissed_Evo01=Strength... unity...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected00=I am granted a reprieve.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Resurrected01=My thanks to you.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeEnd00=It was fate.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeEnd01=Order is restored.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeEnd02=There was no alternative.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeStart00=I shall reclaim my honor!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeStart01=This insult will not be tolerated.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/RevengeStart02=Our enemies must perish!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive00=We must stand as one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Revive01=I cannot fail.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Dance00=I learned this one on Shakuras.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Dance01=Take my hand, and go like this!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Goodbye00=Farewell.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Goodbye01=Until we meet again.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Hello00=En taro Adun.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Hello01=May honor guide us.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Sorry00=My apologies to you, friend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Sorry01=It was my error.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Thanks00=You have my thanks.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_Thanks01=I am in your debt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_WellPlayed00=I see you possess great skill.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Most impressive.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec00=A wise action.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec01=I am intrigued.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec02=Ah, so this is the plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec03=Strategic.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Spec04=That will serve me well.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt00=You behave as though you're from a less... advanced civilization.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt01=If your stupidity does not kill you, my blades will.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt02=My meditation is over. Did yours ever begin?
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt_Evo00=You... less... civil.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt_Evo01=Stupid... kills...
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Taunt_Evo02=You... no... meditate.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/TeamKilled00=This is but the darkness before the dawn.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExLocked00=We must stand together if we are to succeed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Gift00=I offer my aid gladly.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Lockin00=Our time has come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Purchase00=We fight for one cause!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial00=A templar is never above training.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_Trial01=I welcome a challenge.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked00=We must all weigh our actions in this realm.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitLocked01=I see you do not act rashly. I admire that.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=The time for contemplation has passed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Battles are being waged. We must not tarry!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used00=Spear of Adun, fire now!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used01=Activate Purifier Beam!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used02=Commence purification.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Spear... fire.
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used00=Take their vision away!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used01=Behold the power of an arkship!
VoiceOver/ArtanisBase/Ultimate2Used02=Your sight fails you!

VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed00=Dawn will come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed01=Strength in unity.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed02=This realm poses many questions, and few answers...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed03=Were the xel'naga involved in the creation of the Nexus? If so, they have left no temples... no new lifeforms...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed04=Unless those lifeforms were unseen... controlling us through some sort of complicated digital mechanism. Some sort of battle net as it were...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed05=Maybe even thousands of these lifeforms, all manipulating our lives at once?! Agh... Alright, this is giving me a headache.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed06=I wonder what the Daelaam are doing in my absence. Hopefully they haven't rearranged the furnishings in my council chamber. I hate it when they do that.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed07=So, the Spear of Adun is right above me... yet Phase-smith Karax is nowhere to be found? <sigh> Typical. At least he's not bothering me for solarite...
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed08=ALT: So, the Spear of Adun is right above me... yet Phase-smith Karax is nowhere to be found? <sigh> Typical.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed09=Will you stop poking me? Go dispense your aggression on one of the orcs! See how they like it!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed10=By the way, I said StarCraft wasn't just Warcraft in space... Whatever this Heroes of the Storm thing is doesn't count.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed11=Yes, my starship follows me wherever I go. It is like what you terrans refer to as a pet, only useful.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed12=I was only made Hierarch a short time ago, but I'm still thinking about my career advancement. With a little luck, I'll be highestarch in no time.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed13=What do you think of the new armor? My last one left me feeling a little... exposed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed14=I am only young for a protoss. I have lived two centuries more than most of you, and I would appreciate your respect.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Pissed15=I've lived a life that's full. I've traveled each and every star array... And more, much more than this, I did it my way.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected00=I am granted a reprieve.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Resurrected01=My thanks to you.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeEnd00=It was fate.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeEnd01=Order is restored.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeEnd02=There was no alternative.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeStart00=I shall reclaim my honor!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeStart01=This insult will not be tolerated.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/RevengeStart02=Our enemies must perish!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive00=We must stand as one.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Revive01=I cannot fail.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Dance00=I learned this one on Shakuras.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Dance01=Take my hand, and go like this!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Goodbye00=Farewell.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Goodbye01=Until we meet again.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Hello00=En taro Adun.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Hello01=May honor guide us.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Sorry00=My apologies to you, friend.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Sorry01=It was my error.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Thanks00=You have my thanks.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_Thanks01=I am in your debt.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_WellPlayed00=I see you possess great skill.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Social_WellPlayed01=Most impressive.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec00=A wise action.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec01=I am intrigued.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec02=Ah, so this is the plan.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec03=Strategic.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Spec04=That will serve me well.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt00=You behave as though you're from a less... advanced civilization.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt01=If your stupidity does not kill you, my blades will.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Taunt02=My meditation is over. Did yours ever begin?
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/TeamKilled00=This is but the darkness before the dawn.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExLocked00=We must stand together if we are to succeed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_ExPurchased00=Harak en vaiash.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Gift00=I offer my aid gladly.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Lockin00=Our time has come.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Purchase00=We fight for one cause!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial00=A templar is never above training.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_Trial01=I welcome a challenge.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked00=We must all weigh our actions in this realm.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitLocked01=I see you do not act rashly. I admire that.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased00=The time for contemplation has passed.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/UI_WaitPurchased01=Battles are being waged. We must not tarry!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used00=Spear of Adun, fire now!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used01=Activate Purifier Beam!
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate1Used02=Commence purification.
VoiceOver/ArtanisPurifier/Ultimate2Used00=Take their vision away!

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed05=The Burning Court and the High Arena have been locked in the Eternal Playoffs for eons. When the season ends, that "win by two" rule just has to go.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed06=Check yourself, Diablo. This year, the Most Valuable Prime title is mine! <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed07=Court is in session, mortals. And here, I am judge, jury and executioner.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed08=Who's on fire now, Imperius?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed09=My fans call me Azmodunk. But truthfully, my best plays come from way, way, downtown.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed10=First, I shatter the backboard. Then, I shatter your world.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed11=Why do we ball for control of Sanctuary? The finals are hosted there, and whoever holds Sanctuary gets home court advantage.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed12=I tire of these nephalem and their showboating dunks. When I was a rookie, it was about fundamentals!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed13=Malthael played a mean game for the High Arena. It was fortuitous for the Burning Court when he became a free agent.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed14=I'll let you in on a little secret. It's actually never the shoes... They, uhm, uh, don't fit.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Pissed15=My face was once on a box of cereal. But for some reason children stopped eating breakfast. I have no idea why.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Social_Hello00=Yo. Sup?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Social_Hello01=You gonna play, or just talk?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Social_Sorry00=I got robbed.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Social_Sorry01=Uhm... That was your fault.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Social_Thanks00=I thank you.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec00=Sweet.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec01=Whatever you say, coach.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec02=That shall make a killer replay.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec03=None shall expect that.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Spec04=Ah, ballin'.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt00=How can you stop me, if you can't even see me?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt01=This is my house.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Taunt02=Who threw this trash onto MY court?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/TeamKilled00=Next time I want to see some hustle out there.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExLocked00=Welcome to my jam.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_ExPurchased00=Up for another game?
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Gift00=You? Trading me? Never liked this team anyways.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Lockin00=Let's jam!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Purchase00=First draft pick.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_Trial00=Prepare to be azmodazzled.

VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked00=I only play with the best. Let's see if you've got any game.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitLocked01=Let's get onto the court.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased00=You seem to have mistaken me for a bench-warmer. Unwise.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/UI_WaitPurchased01=I devised a new play while I was waiting. It's called, the "stop squandering my time and let's play" play.
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used00=Here's the hot zone!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used01=Shoot within the key!
VoiceOver/AzmodanAzmodunk/Ultimate1Used02=Watch the shot clock.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Caution00=Be on your guard. Our foes are coming.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_GoodJob00=You are not entirely worthless.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/AI_Uhoh02=Insolence!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Attack00=Insignificant whelp!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Chen00=Just what is that liquid you keep consuming?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Well, if it isn't the nephalem.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Hmm, what part of Hell are you from?
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=You... I see they are sending out the dreck today.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=You appear to be ready for war.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroQuestion_Prime00=We must take this world for our own.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond00=I have been waiting for this.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroRespond01=I hold the power of Hell.

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/IntroResponse_Agree00=<reuses introresponse00_04>

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed04=If you think my current form is impressive, wait until you behold my floating head taunts! <evil laugh>
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed05=Leading the Sin Lieutenants is not easy. Sloth is late, Wrath is belligerent, Pride thinks Greed is stealing, Envy is jealous Greed gets away with it, and Gluttony tries to eat everyone. As for Lust, well... She is VERY distracting.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed06=<snoring> Neffalumps and woozles... Here! There! Everywhere! <wakes up an growls> These damned nephalem torment me even in my sleep!

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed11=Those who believe there are only seven deadly sins lack imagination.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed12=This is starting to hurt more than my piercings.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed13=Can everyone just stop for a moment? I need to write a series of lore books about this battle and then spend some time scattering them about!
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed14=What? How dare you refer to me a "Lesser" evil! I prefer the term "evilly challenged."
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed15=<growl> I am so azmodone with this.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed_Evo00=Tempt not...
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/Pissed_Evo01=Where nephalem?

VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/RevengeEnd00=Your flesh was made to die.
VoiceOver/AzmodanBase/RevengeEnd01=Hah! You were weak after all.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Heal00=Ai ya... That must hurt. Head to a healing fountain, quick!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Heal01=You should heal, before you... you know, can't.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_MercCapture00=I think I'll make some new mercenary friends.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_OnMyWay00=I'm on my way to help!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_OnMyWay01=You could use some help there.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Retreat00=I must pull back, friend.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Retreat01=I have to retreat, for now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Uhoh00=Oh no.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Uhoh01=Yeesh.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/AI_Uhoh02=Ah, well then.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack00=Taste this!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack01=Have one on the house!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack02=Try a little Stormstout Fu!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack03=It is time!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack04=Ah! A new challenger appears!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack05=I bring panda-monium!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack06=For Pandaria!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Evo00=Taste... this.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Evo01=One on... house.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Evo02=Pandaria.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Evo03=Stormstout Fu.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Attack_Evo04=Hyah.

VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed_Split01=Fire: "That feels good."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Healed_Split02=Earth: "What a pick me up."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree00=Someday this will make a great story.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree01=Don't be too hasty. Focus your mind and body, friend.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroAgree02=Victory will not be easy, but few things are.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroBoast00=This should be fun.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroBoast01=This will be a battle to remember!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion00=Well, ready for action?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion01=Are you ready for a little panda-monium?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Well, you are quite the strange ally! They call me, Chen...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_LiLi00=Now, Li Li, do not stray too far...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Oh, a murloc? How did you get here?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=I see... <sip> it is you.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Oh hello, friend! It is good to see you once again!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Rexxar00=Rexxar! It has been ages!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroQuestion_Samuro00=Blademaster! It is good to fight with you once more!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond00=Haha, of course!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond01=I have been practicing some new moves...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroRespond02=Ah, but the battle begins regardless.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Would you like a sip? I promise it will put hair all over you!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_LiLi00=<SFX: Drinking> Ahh! I am now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Uhm... well... I... I've got nothing.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Mmm... We must put aside our differences for now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_OfCourse00=<Reuses IntroRespond00>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Come... Let us fight for home, for family, and for honor.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Rexxar00=Lok'tar ogar, my friend!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/IntroResponse_Samuro00=If fighting is what is required, then I shall be ready.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill00=Can't handle your brew, eh?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill01=Let's do that again sometime!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill02=Oh-ho-ho! How's the floor taste?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill03=Now that was a good fight!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Kill04=Oh, I guess you were the endangered one!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillDwarf00=Ayee... Some dwarves just can't handle their brew.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillLiLi00=A good effort, Li Li! Get up, and we'll try that again.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillRexxar00=Getting too long in the tooth, Rexxar? <laughs>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSamuro00=Better to master the brew, than the blade.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSkeletonKing00=Whoa, you should REALLY put some meat on those bones.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/KillSpreeEnd00=All things must come to an end.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowHealth00=My health is low.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal00=Hey yo. Thank you... Was getting rough there.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal01=Ahh, that feels so much better.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowLifeHeal02=<chuckle> I'm sure glad you're around.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana00=I could use some brew right now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana01=I think it's time for some brew.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana02=Who needs a brew? Oh, I do!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/LowMana_Evo00=Need brew.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No00=I do not think so.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No01=Not this time, friend.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/No02=And how would I do that?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Quickly, our ally needs help.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Uhm, I could use some help!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Assist me my friends!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Attack00=We should attack here.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Let us attack the enemy's core!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Let's capture this mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Destroy this fort!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We should secure this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Capture00=Perhaps we should capture this.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Capture01=We should capture this objective.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Collect00=Friends, we should gather these.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Collect01=Get those, quick!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Danger00=Be wary, friends. Danger comes for us.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Danger01=We must be careful!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Defend00=Hmm. We ought to defend here.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=We should defend this fort.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Defend this structure.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Protect it, quick!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendThing00=We must protect our ally.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Do not let them fall.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DefendTower00=We should defend this watch tower.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Demolish that structure!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Let us bring that structure down!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Take that enemy out!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Defeat that enemy, quickly!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Be cautious. Our enemy has gone missing.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Hmm, our enemy has dissapeared. Curious.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_KillHero00=Will someone knock this hero out cold!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=<excited exertion> I am coming!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Heading your way now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Retreat00=Get out of there!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Retreat01=Run! Retreat! Go!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Transport00=Well, we can't leave this here.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_Transport01=Let us get that moving.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Alright, let's turn these in.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ping_TurnIn01=We should turn these in now.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed00=Hey yo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed01=Is trouble brewing?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed02=Accentuate the positive. Eliminate the negative.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed03=Oh, yes...  I have many many stories to tell. Would you like to hear one? <beat> Nine ninety-five per minute.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed04=An interesting old man once told me, "Stay thirsty, my friend." <pleh> Such terrible advice! <SFX: Sips his drink> Ahh!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed05=Homebrew is the best brew, because you can drink it right away!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed06=You know, if you're in the area, you should stop by the Stormstout Brewery. It seems like there's always chores to do.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed07=A wise man once said, "An empty cup, is simply one that has not been refilled." <SFX: tapping on the side of a cup> <clears throat> Ahem.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed08=It is important to master the brew, and not to let it master you.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed09=Oh, and to drink a lot of water. That is also important.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed10=Not all who wander are lost... I mean, sure, I'm lost... but not ALL of us are.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed11=For some, the journey IS the destination.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed12=The wanderer's way is to observe... to drink in another's culture. Then to take that knowlege and live a fulfilled life. The Dark Wanderer's way, however... Aye... Let's just say it ends badly.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed13=To ask why we fight, is to ask why you are playing Heroes of the Storm. It is for the experience. Perhaps there is a better question.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed14=Chen Stormstout, Brewmaster. Ask for me by name, and accept no cheap substitutes!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Evo00=Hey... yo.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Evo01=Trouble brewing.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split00=Yes?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split01=We heed the call.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split02=Earth: "Wait... I'm Earth, and he's fire... Shouldn't you be wind?" Fire: "Quiet... Or do you want to get sued?"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split03=Fire: "For us, every kill is a triple kill."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split04=Storm: "Keep it up and you'll be in big trouble, little child."
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Pissed_Split05=Storm: "You could say..." Fire: "We, have a split..." Earth: "Banana!" Storm: "<sigh> You know what, just go over there... I can't even look at you right now"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected00=I am in your debt, friend.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Resurrected01=<excited exertion> I owe you one.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeEnd00=So... what did you learn?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeEnd01=There is a lesson here for you.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeEnd02=Vengeance solves little. But it can be fun.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeStart00=Ah, a poor decision on your part.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeStart01=And now, we duel.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/RevengeStart02=Hmm, a worthy foe.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive00=Okay... I'm up! I'm up!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive01=Ai ya! I'm still feeling that one!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Revive02=Fresh, cool brew here.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Dance00=Watch this!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Dance01=Now this is how you do a barrel roll.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Goodbye00=May your journey be long.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Goodbye01=Until next time.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Hello00=Hey yo!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Hello01=Hello there!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Sorry00=I am sorry.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Sorry01=The fault was mine.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Thanks00=Why, thank you!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_Thanks01=<excited exertion> Thank you very much!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Ha! Well done there!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Now that you'll have to show me again some time!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec00=Hey, I like it!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec01=Not bad, not bad.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec02=Experience leads to strength.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec03=<laugh> That's a good one!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Spec04=Ancient Pandaren secret, huh?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt00=Let's rumble!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt01=You there! Show me what you got!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt02=I will take you on with my bear hands! <laugh>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Evo00=Let us... rumble.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Evo01=Show me... what... got.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Evo02=Bear hands...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split00=Storm: "Let us rumble!""
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split01=Fire: "You there! Show us what you've got!"
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Taunt_Split02=Earth: "We'll take you down with our bear hands!" <laughs>
VoiceOver/ChenBase/TeamKilled00=Do not get discouraged. We will get them soon enough.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExLocked00=Well, hello!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_ExPurchased00=[Surprise 50]Ah,[/Surprise] [Happy 80]welcome back friend.[/Happy]
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Gift00=Oh, I'll give 'em a big ol' bear hug for ya.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Lockin00=I bring panda-monium!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Purchase00=An excellent decision, my friend!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial00=Oh, interested in learning Stormstout Fu, are we?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_Trial01=Always wise to sample the wares.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Take all the time you need. For if we never take time, how can we have time?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitLocked01=You look familiar. Did I meet you in Pandaria?
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Ready for another round yet? No? Good, I'm feeling thirsty.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Oh no. My brew is getting warm... I hate it when that happens.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used00=Storm, Earth, Fire! Heed my call!
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used01=The elements heed my call.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Storm. Earth. Fire...
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Elements... heed call.
VoiceOver/ChenBase/Ultimate2Used00=It's time you got smashed!

VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_DiabloHero00=It has been a long time since you were in the fight. Are you ready?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil00=Your kind of evil should not be allowed to roam freely.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil01=Another temporary alliance, I see.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Evil02=You live on borrowed time, miscreant.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good00=Always good to fight alongside allies I can believe in.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good01=Ah, so it's you. That will make things easier.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Good02=Let's do some good out there, shall we?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Leoric, how does it feel to be on the right side, for once?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Lord00=A Lord of Hell fights by my side? The end times are near.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=Haven't I killed you SEVERAL TIMES, Malthael?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Mephisto00=The Lord of Hatred... Very impressive, I'm sure.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Have you reconsidered my offer, Murky? I could use a good apprentice.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Do you truly think you are worthy to fight by my side?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Now that we are together, do you think our enemy has any chance at all?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Tyrael, it is an honor to fight by your side.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroQuestion_Uther00=Think you can keep up, paladin?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond00=I am always ready.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond01=The crusade brought me here.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroRespond02=Always.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=It is unwise to provoke a crusader.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Is that all? I expected a discourse on how I'll never defeat you. Again.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Yes, scary. Maybe you could try that on our enemies.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Confused00=I'm sorry... what?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=We are a match for them regardless.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=Perhaps you can tell me about it AFTER the fight, Deckard?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=The opinions of a demon have never mattered to me.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_DiabloHero00=Let's defeat our foe, and then we can worry about how to get home.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=<sigh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil00=I'd much prefer fighting against you, rather than with you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil01=The world would be a lot better off without you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Evil02=Is it too late to request new allies?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Excited00=Now that I can accommodate.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good00=As Akarat wills, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good01=I shall be your shield.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Good02=We'll do this together!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=I've kept worse company, I suppose. Have you met Lyndon?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Lord00=The same goes for you, demon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=We fight together, Malthael. So I will not destroy you... probably.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Mephisto00=(Negatively scolding)Ah, ah, ah! Flattery will get you nowhere.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Words of wisdom, as always, my articulate friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=We're allies for now. Let us focus on our true foes.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_No00=I'm certainly not dignifying that with a response.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Together again! We'll be unstoppable.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=And yours, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Uther00=Yes, me. You know, no one will judge you if you can't keep up, paladin. You're simply outclassed.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Yeah, that's not how this works.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill00=Akarat have mercy on you, for I will not!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill01=The crusade comes for you!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill02=At least you tried.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill03=Until next time.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Kill04=Bad luck for you, friend!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillAngel00=Back to the Heavens with you!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillButcher00=The spirits of the dead are now avenged.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDeckard00=Sorry, old friend. Perhaps you should talk less...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDemon00=You cannot hide from me in this realm, demon!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiablo00=How many times is that, Diablo? I always lose count.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillDiabloHero00=Your time has passed, hero. 
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillLeoric00=Go back to your dungeon, Leoric.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillMephisto00=Weren't you supposed to be the clever one?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillNephalem00=My apologies, nephalem.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillSpreeEnd00=That's enough of that!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillTyrael00=It is the age of the nephalem, old friend
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillUther00=Paladins. Hah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/KillWhitemane00=That's one less fanatic.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh00=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh01=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh02=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh03=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Laugh04=<laugh>
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowHealth00=My health is low.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal00=That was close!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal01=Excellently done, healer.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowLifeHeal02=Let's not cut it that close again.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana01=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana02=I require more mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/LowMana_Evo00=Need... mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No00=No.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No01=I cannot.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/No02=Not now.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally needs help!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I require your aid!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I could use your assistance!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Attack00=We should attack here.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=To the enemy core! The time is now!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Let's befriend these mercenaries.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Let us storm this fort!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Claim that watchtower.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Capture00=We should capture this.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Capture01=Let us drive them away from this.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Collect00=We should gather these.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Collect01=Let us collect these quickly!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Danger00=Be cautious.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Danger01=Danger is close.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Defend00=Defend here!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Make our stand at the core!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Hold the line at this fort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Defend this structure.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Let us protect this structure!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendThing00=We must defend our ally!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Our friend must not fall!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Defend this watchtower.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Burn that structure to the ground.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Destroy that structure!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Let us kill this enemy.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=It is time for this enemy to fall.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=An enemy is missing.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Watch out, one of our enemies has disappeared.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_KillHero00=That hero must be taken out -- and soon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=On my way!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=I am coming.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Retreat00=Fall back!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Retreat01=Retreat!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Transport00=We should not leave this lying about.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_Transport01=We must get this moving.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Let us turn these in.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ping_TurnIn01=We should turn these in now.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed00=Hello.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed01=Yes? What do you need?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed02=Why are you clicking on me, and not on my enemies or loot? What kind of game is this?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed03=Jokes? You're expecting jokes? Fine, I believe I can accommodate.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed04=A crusader, a paladin and a templar walk into a tavern. And then they all have a drink. <laugh> ...no?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed05=...well not everyone appreciates crusader humor.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed06=Someday I will cleanse the Zakarum faith and our crusade will end. What'll I do then, I wonder? Well I'm sure there'll be something that needs a good smiting!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed07=This "Nexus" looks strange to my eyes. Something about how the light hits everything...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed08=The most important thing about wearing heavy armor, is to NEVER think about how much it itches... <complaining exertion> Oh, that's going to get annoying...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed09=Oh, Akarat, bless this, thy holy flail that with it, thou mayest smite thine enemies into tiny, tiny, unfathomably tiny bits. In thy mercy. Let it be so.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed10=I bear my Master's name, as her master did before her. Someday my apprentice will bear mine, and she will find an apprentice to bear it after her. We all have the same name, that's what I'm getting at.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed11=Our order is made up of a many different people with varied and unique backgrounds. We're actually quite a Motley crusade.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed12=Some fellow mistook me for a templar yesterday. I asked him, "Have you ever heard me shout 'Glorious!'?" He answered "I have now." He was a witty fellow, shame he's dead now.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed13=Click me one more time and by Akarat, I'll cut off your finger. Or whatever else you use to work that little mouse.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed_Evo00=Hello...
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Pissed_Evo01=What... want?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected00=You have my gratitude, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Resurrected01=My thanks.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeEnd00=Well that was gratifying.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeEnd01=I enjoyed that.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeEnd02=This is what happens when you make a crusader angry.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeStart00=That won't be happening again.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeStart01=You will feel the fury of Akarat!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/RevengeStart02=I will find you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive00=I return!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive01=Back in the fight.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Revive02=I should get an apprentice soon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Dance00=I have moves on the battlefield, and off.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Dance01=Hold your applause till the end.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Goodbye00=Farewell.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Goodbye01=We shall fight side by side again.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Hello00=Good day to you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Hello01=Hello, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Sorry00=I apologize.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Sorry01=I am sorry.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Thanks00=Thank you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_Thanks01=You have my gratitude.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Well done.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Impressive.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec00=Nice choice.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec01=Excellent.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec02=I grow stronger in the Light.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec03=As it should be.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Spec04=I think so, yes.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt00=If your side has any real heroes, please, send them my way.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt01=You would not last long on the crusade.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt02=My apprentice could take you. And I don't even have one!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt_Evo00=You... not real hero.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt_Evo01=Weak.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Taunt_Evo02=Unfit.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/TeamKilled00=I've come back from worse. Do not lose hope.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExLocked00=Greetings, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_ExPurchased00=An old friend returns.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Gift00=You have a generous spirit.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Lockin00=The crusade calls.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Purchase00=You chose wisely.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial00=Yes, let's give it a try, shall we?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_Trial01=You wish to join the crusade?
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked00=You consider your actions before committing. Very wise.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitLocked01=You're a thoughtful sort.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=The crusade calls us, my friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Ah... There is a certain beauty in the stillness. Let's kill it.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used00=Let the heavens' wrath fall.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Heavens wrath.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Faith smite.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo02=Crusade marches on.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used00=Faith is my shield.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used01=You go no further.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used02=Halt!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used03=Here, catch!
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used04=This stops here.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Faith. My shield.
VoiceOver/CrusaderBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo01=No further.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Demon00=A demon? Shame. I was hoping for an ally who actually wins once in a while.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil00=The warsong do not ally willingly with evil.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil01=You are beneath me. Stay out of my way.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Evil02=You? Ugh. Ancestors save me...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=Garrosh. Not all Warsong are willing to follow you into madness.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Gazlowe00=Gazlowe? Ha. Should prove entertaining at the least.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good00=Aren't you a bit of a goody-goody? Whatever, close enough.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good01=Glad to see at least one warrior with honor here.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Good02=Ah, it's you. I can work with this.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Horde00=Lok'tar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_JunkratGoblin00=Stay behind me, and blow up anything that gets in our way!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Another of Sylvanas's lackeys, I presume.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=Wait, are there three of you? Think you can keep up with me?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Murky00=A murloc! I used to punt you into rivers! <laugh> Oh, sorry.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<scoff> How I tire of weak allies.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Ha, you look tough.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Thrall00=Warchief Thrall. It is an honor.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Uther00=I remember the armor of Lordaeron, paladin. We Warsong have not forgotten your camps.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Whitemane00=One of those Scarlet Zealots? <spit> What a waste.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroQuestion_Yrel00=A draenei? Not what I was expecting.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond00=Lok'tar ogar!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond01=I feel the fury in my blood already.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroRespond02=When these gates go down, you'll see.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Don't worry, Alliance dog. The Horde will win this battle for you.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Angry00=I will shatter every bone in your body!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_AurielSpirit00=A spirit healer? I'm not dead am I?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Butcher00=<Growls back>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Confused00=What was that noise? Was that thing talking?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=I don't know you, human. And I don't care to!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Demon00=The orcs have had enough of your kind, demon.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Dismiss00=I do not need your opinion, whelp.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil00=Hush, the battle is beginning. I'll deal with you later.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil01=I'll remember that when you're facing against me.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Evil02=I'm here to fight the enemy, not you. Yet...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Excited00=<laugh> Excellent!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=At least that I can agree with.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Gazlowe00=Itchy and tired.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good00=Always good to stand with warriors I can put my trust in.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good01=Honor shall be our shield, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Good02=Strength, friend.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Horde00=For the Horde!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_JunkratGoblin00=Are you kidding me? I WILL bash your face in, you know that right?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Who died and made you king?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=What's a tomator? Can you eat it?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Murky00=And they say orcish is hard to understand.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Negative00=Just shut up.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_No00=Have you lost your wits? Of course not.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Positive00=Alright. I've been waiting for a good fight!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, of course. <scoff>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Thrall00=Lok-narash!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Uther00=Give it a rest, human. I'm not happy about this either.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Whitemane00=Talk down to me again, pinkskin! I love putting pale dogs in their place.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/IntroResponse_Yrel00=How noble. Shut up and fight, draenei.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill00=Blood and thunder!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill01=That felt good.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill02=I've fought MUCH better.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill03=What was that? Pah!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill04=Another! Bring me another!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Kill05=Shattered like bone against steel.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAlliance00=Alliance filth.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillAngel00=These spirit healers are getting aggressive.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillChogall00=That's what traitors get! The both of you!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillCrusader00=Did that human... have my face? I must be seeing things.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDemon00=Looks like the burning legion is in need of new recruits.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillDwarf00=Alterac belongs to the Frostwolves!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillGuldan00=You deserve a much worse fate, warlock.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillHorde00=You die well, warrior of the Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillLeoric00=Come back soon, so I can kill you again!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNephalem00=Surprisingly strong... for a human.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillNightElf00=Ha! An elf head! Najak's gonna love it.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSpreeEnd00=Killing spree over, whelp!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillSylvanas00=<scoff> Not my warchief...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillUther00=Paladins. Bah.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWarchief00=You'd think an ex-warchief would be harder to kill.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/KillWhitemane00=Self-righteous brat!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Laugh01=<medium laugh>

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowLifeHeal02=My thanks. Now, back to the fight!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana01=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/LowMana02=Are you kidding? I'm exhausted!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd00=Victory is mine!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd01=I am proud to serve.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/MatchEnd02=It was my honor.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No00=Hah, no.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No01=Impossible.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/No02=Don't you have better things to do?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in trouble!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AssistMe00=Assist me!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_AttackTower00=Claim this watch tower.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Capture00=Capture this! Now!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Capture01=This would be better off in our possession.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Collect00=Gather those before the enemy gets their paws on them.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Collect01=Obtain these, quickly.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Danger00=This area is dangerous.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Danger01=Stay away!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Defend00=We should defend here.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendCastle00=Protect our core!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Defend this fort!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DefendTower00=Keep the enemy away from this watch tower.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Raze that structure to the ground!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Warriors, focus upon that structure!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DestroyThing00=I've had enough of this thing! Bring it to its knees!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_DestroyThing01=Kill that thing before I lose my temper!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_EnemyMissing00=An enemy has fled! Coward!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_EnemyMissing01=An enemy is missing. Do not fall for their tricks.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_KillHero00=I want this hero dead!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_OnMyWay00=I'm headed this way.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_OnMyWay01=Moving out.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Retreat00=Pull back!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Retreat01=Retreat!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_Transport00=Move this thing.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_TurnIn00=Head to the turn in point.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ping_TurnIn01=Hand over whatever you've collected.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed00=Mok'ra.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed01=What can I do for you?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed02=Back off, whelp!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed03=Stop poking me!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed04=Hah, missed me!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed05=That's it! Flag for PvP, I dare you!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed06=I thought I saw a human version of myself on the battlefield once. All blonde and proper. Bleh, just the thought of it is repulsive.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed07=You think 30 minutes is tough? I once fought in Alterac Valley for two days straight! Might have gone faster if everyone wasn't standing in a cave, but that's beside the point!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed08=I lost my husband in the barrens once. Was practically a corpse when I found him.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed09=Some humans think of orcs as misunderstood noble warriors. They try to talk out our problems. The look on their faces when I bash in their teeth is priceless.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed10=You ever notice how orc quest-givers can speak common, but orc adventures can't? What's the deal with that?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed11=So quick aside, what's going here? Am I an orc paladin? Is that even a thing? I'm pretty sure that's not a thing.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed12=I'm a crusader? What's a Crusader? <beat> Right, how is that not just a paladin? <beat> (sigh)You know what--You know what? How about we just move on.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed13=Always check your dire wolf for fleas BEFORE mounting up. That is one ride you don't want to take.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Pissed14=I used to be a Warsong Commander. Loved charging into battle! But uh, some stuff went down... we became less popular... L-look, the point is, I had to find new work.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected00=My ancestors demanded that I return.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Resurrected01=Thank you, the world had grown dark.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive00=My life for the Horde!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive01=Who did that?
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive02=Strength and honor!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Revive03=No resurrection sickness? Ha!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Social_Goodbye00=Strength.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Social_Goodbye01=Peace, friend.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Spec04=Glory to the Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt00=Honor is my shield.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Taunt01=You dispute my honor?

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/TeamKilled00=<angry exertion> They got all of us...
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_ExLocked00=Greetings, friend.

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Lockin00=For the Horde.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_Purchase00=That's the stuff!

VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased00=Would you hurry up and do something? I don't want to get flagged AFK.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/UI_WaitPurchased01=It's awfully quiet around here... I hate it.
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate1Used00=Now... you... fall!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used00=Stop right there!
VoiceOver/CrusaderOrc/Ultimate2Used01=I will break your face!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Healed_Evo01=Fresh flower.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree00=Naturally.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree01=The idea is growing on me.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroAgree02=I know what you mean.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroBoast00=Our enemies will wither before us.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroBoast01=The savage defeat the tamed every time.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready for a wild battle?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion01=You look like you're ready for trouble.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Chogall00=How dare you show your face here. Er, faces.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=Why hello there, sister.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Greymane00=Ah, the man who's almost a wolf.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=So you made it all the way out here, Archdruid.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Monk00=What are you staring at?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=Ah, um, I'm so out of practice... <speaking in hesitant nerglish, like saying "hello">Mrrglr? 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=Why do you bring death to these lands?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=How am I supposed to help someone like you?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Now you are just the kind of ally I need!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond00=Why else would I be here?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond01=Of course. That's the point.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroRespond02=You have no idea what I will unleash here.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Alexstrasza00=Of course. That's the point.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=There are predators and prey. I don't think you're the one you think you are.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=There is a place for all creatures, even rude ones.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Chogall00=I would rather see them burn!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Oh, was that the breeze, or did you say something?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=This place makes the Emerald Dream look normal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Greymane00=You aren't going to mark the trees as territory, are you?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Do you think the words of a mortal mean anything to the child of a god?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=I wish you wouldn't do that.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Monk00=Hopefully that's not all they've favored you with.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Mrglrlg. Mrgglr!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=Just keep your skeletons to yourself, alright?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Have you ever considered just going away?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Eh, this could be fun.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Quite the wilting flower, aren't you?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Right... I am going to pretend this didn't happen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill00=Fresh food for the plants.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill01=It's only what you deserved.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill02=Think again before you trespass.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill03=You are one with the forest now.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Kill04=It had to come to this...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillDryad00=Why must we fight like this, sister?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGazlowe00=Looks like you had a breakdown.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillGreymane00=Just a man in wolf's skin.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillIllidan00=Haven't you ruined enough worlds?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillMalfurion00=You never tried hard enough, Malfurion.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillSpreeEnd00=You hunted the wrong game.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/KillTechCharacter00=All that metal for nothing.

VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal01=Whew, I appreciate that.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowLifeHeal02=That's much better.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana00=I'm low on mana.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana01=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana02=Great... My mana's low.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/LowMana_Evo00=Mana low...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No00=I think not!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No01=Not really, no.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/No02=<scoff> Impossible.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistHero00=This ally needs us.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Time to work as a team and actually help me!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I could use some help here.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Attack00=Attack here!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Tear down the enemy's core!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Seize this mercenary camp!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Destroy this wretched fort!

VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Capture01=Let's take this.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Collect00=Collect these.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Collect01=We need to grab these.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Danger00=I sense danger here.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Danger01=Something is not right here.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Defend00=Defend here, or we'll regret it.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Our core needs protection!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Don't let our fort fall!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Don't let this structure fall.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Make sure this stays standing... for now.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Protect this one.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendThing01=This one stays alive. Got it?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DefendTower00=This watch tower won't last long without us.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Destroy this and let nature take its place.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Bring this ugly structure down.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=I've had enough of this one...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Can we kill this one?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Our enemy is playing tricks on us!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Did anyone see where that enemy went?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_KillHero00=We should bring this hero down.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=All right, I'm going.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=I'm headed here.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Retreat00=Fall back, everyone!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Retreat01=We have to go away for now.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Transport00=Get this thing moving.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_Transport01=This has to move.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Time to turn everything in.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Go on and turn these in.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed00=I am the first of the dryads.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed01=The forest does not need protection, but you do.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed02=We will take back what mortals have stolen.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed03=My father Cenarius has power. But I have determination.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed04=Don't misunderstand me--mortals are very good at slaying each other. But the wilds are even better at it.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed05=Something is off about the plants in the Garden of Terror... What are they using for fertilizer? 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed06=Dryads do not graze, and I find that offensive. 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed07=To be honest, I only eat organic. You would too if there were goblins mining your homeland.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed08=You might say I'm a force of nature.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed09=Go play outside, they told you... It's perfectly safe, they told you... I guess they didn't know about me.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed10=...And then she said, "I'm so wasted, I'm so wasted!" And I told her if she didn't shut up right then, I'd send her to the glue factory.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed11=There is nothing like the beauty of the outdoors-- the poisons, and thorns, and cute little choking vines! I could stare at them all day.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed12=I'm game! I mean, I'm IN a game. Between humans and the forest--good versus evil--or maybe just red versus blue.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed13=Look, I did not choose to be called Lunara. My father named me after my grandmother. Always stuck in the past, my old man...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed14=Call me Mylune, and I'll kick you with my front hooves and my back ones.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed15=Most dryads are fluent in deer, rabbit, and bird, but I also speak snake, bear, and a few rare scorpion dialects. <hissing> Hsss. Hss. HSSS!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed16=I bet you've never been to a dryad party! We go through more moonberry juice than the entire Darkmoon Faire.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed17=(instructing someone on how to move like a dryad) And now, we frolic. Bound and leap, bound and leap, bound--and of course, leap.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed18=You've ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin mine!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed_Evo00=First dryad...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Pissed_Evo01=Forest not need you...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected00=Nice one.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Resurrected01=Thank you, friend. This is not over.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeEnd00=There you have it.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeEnd01=Nature isn't kind, and neither am I.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeEnd02=May something better grow in your place.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeStart00=I'm not going to allow this!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeStart01=You just made me angry.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/RevengeStart02=This poison is for you...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive00=I am eternal.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive01=Life finds a way.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Revive02=My fight isn't over.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Dance00=I could pay attention to you... but I'm going to do this instead.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Dance01=Sometimes I watch the grass grow... and sometimes I do this.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Goodbye00=Until next time.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Goodbye01=See you in the wilds.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Hello00=Greetings.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Hello01=What is it?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Sorry00=Sorry. That was not my intention. 
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Sorry01=I have to apologize for that.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Thanks00=Thank you for that.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_Thanks01=You have earned my respect.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_WellPlayed00=That was pretty good!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Social_WellPlayed01=You're not so bad at this.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec00=That will be good.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec01=Ah, I can use that.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec02=Perfect.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec03=Nature bestows many gifts.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Spec04=I feel stronger already.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt00=What's the matter? Do you have allergies? <laughs>
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt01=You may have met some nice dryads. I'm not one of them.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt02=You're going to make great mulch.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt_Evo00=You... have... allergies?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt_Evo01=Not nice dryad.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Taunt_Evo02=You... great mulch.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/TeamKilled00=Cut us down, and we will grow back!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExLocked00=Does something intrigue you, mortal?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Allies of the forest are welcome.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Gift00=You are giving me away? What am I, flowers?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Lockin00=The hunt is on!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Purchase00=Nature's blessings upon you!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial00=Well, all right.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_Trial01=As long as this doesn't take too long.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked00=I long for the fields of Kalimdor...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitLocked01=The wild places call to me.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=I have waited too long.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Stop watching me. I'm not going to do anything cute.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used00=You can't run from nature.
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used01=Suffer as the wildlands have suffered!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used02=Let's get to the root of this problem!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Can't run...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Suffer like wilds...
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used00=Why don't you slow down for awhile?
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used01=Leaps and bounds ahead of you!
VoiceOver/DryadBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Slow down...

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Malfurion00=I do not accept help easily, Archdruid. Thank you for offering it all the same.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=I hear Stormwind considers your kind a menace.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Allies like you make me want to stand alone.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=If I am to accept help, then I am glad it comes from you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_RehgarSW00=(Outraged) Is that a wolf's pelt on your head!?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=You think us allies? Once this is done, I'll kill you too.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroQuestion_Varian00=We may both be kings, but I lead the pack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond00=A true Gilnean is always ready.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond01=I've seen many a war; this will be no different.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroRespond02=Witness what happens when I'm pushed too far.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Ana00=Witness what happens when I'm pushed too far.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=Do not test my patience!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Everything I did was for Gilneas. Everything you did was for yourself.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Baelog00=Be quiet, or you'll see my fangs up close.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=I was hoping for dependable allies. I suppose you will have to do, instead.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Erik00=I'm a WORGEN! W-O-R-G-E-N, worgen!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Kael'thas00=My people may have become worgen, but you nearly turned yours into demons.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Expertise in what, exactly? Leading your people into ruin or being slain by them?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Lunara00=Ah, the woman who's almost a deer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Malfurion00=Today I repay the debt my people owe you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=Ha! To think a creature like you could cause so much chaos.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=If it were up to me, you'd be on the other side of this battle.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Neutral00=Our fates are intertwined.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=You're one of the few around here I trust, you know.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_RehgarSW00=(Condescending) Ah, Rehgar. The orc who tries so hard to be a wolf.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=And perhaps your people will lose theirs.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/IntroResponse_Varian00=You merely ACT the wolf. I BECOME the wolf.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill00=Fall before me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill01=You had no chance.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill02=Die like the dog you are.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill03=That's Gilnean hospitality for you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill04=<Ahem> Next?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas00=Terenas, let this be my atonement.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillArthas_W00=I have done what Terenas could not.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh00=Now for the rest of your filthy Horde.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillGarrosh_W00=Lo'gosh isn't the wolf you should be worried about.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKael'thas00=Return to your precious Sunwell.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillKaelthas_W00=Ugh, you singed my fur.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric00=Such is the fate of all unworthy kings.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLeoric_W00=Don't worry, Leoric. I'll be sure to bury your bones. (Snickers)
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara00=Perhaps nature needed protection from humans after all.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillLunara_W00=Looks like the wilds favored me, this time.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion00=My apologies, Archdruid. But it had to be done.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillMalfurion_W00=Perhaps you were right, Malfurion. This "pack form" is dangerous.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpreeEnd00=You almost had me seeing red.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSpree_W00=I am the alpha!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas00=Justice for Liam! For all Gilneans!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillSylvanas_W00=At last, I spill your putrid blood!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther00=You were a hero of the Alliance... but not of Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillUther_W00=I always knew I would outlive you, Uther.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/KillVarian_W00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W00=This is my kill!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W01=Thanks for sharpening my claws.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W02=Such easy prey.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W03=This is hungry work.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Kill_W04=I'm the best at what I do.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh00=<Hearty, good natured laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh01=<Derisive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh02=<Vindictive laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh03=<Amused, but subdued laugh>

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W07=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W08=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Laugh_W09=<Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowHealth00=My health is low.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowHealth_W00=I need to lick my wounds.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal00=Glory unto you, healer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal01=As long as I live, so does Gilneas.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal02=Grace under pressure. Thank you, healer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W00=<Gasps> That was close. Thank you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W01=From the jaws of defeat...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowLifeHeal_W02=I owe you my life, healer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana00=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana01=I need more mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana02=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_Evo00=Mana... low...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_Evo_W00=Mana low.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W00=I am running out of mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W01=My mana is low.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/LowMana_W02=I need to regain some mana.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No00=Never.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No01=No.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No02=Denied.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W00=Can't do that.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W01=Impossible.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/No_W02=I refuse.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is in need!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistHero_W00=One of our pack needs us!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe00=Assist me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Rally on my position!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W00=Attack with me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AssistMe_W01=Fight as one!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Attack00=Take the fight to the enemy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Finish this! Destroy their core!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackCastle_W00=Go for the kill! Destroy the core!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Take this camp and bolster our ranks!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackMerc_W00=Show these mercenaries who's boss.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=It's time to raze the enemy's fort.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackOutpost_W00=Tear down that fort!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Claim this tower as our own!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_AttackTower_W00=Take this watch tower!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Attack_W00=We should strike here!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Capture00=Capturing this is our highest priority!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Capture01=Do not let the enemy capture this before us!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Capture_W00=Take this for ourselves!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Capture_W01=They will not take what is ours!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Collect00=Claim these to ensure victory.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Collect01=We must gather these immediately.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Collect_W00=These belong to us!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Collect_W01=Gather and hoard these!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Danger00=On your guard.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Danger01=Danger is near.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Danger_W00=Wait! Something doesn't smell right.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Danger_W01=Danger is afoot.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Defend00=Hold the line!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend the core!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendCastle_W00=Get them off our core!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Our fort must not fall!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendOutpost_W00=Defend our territory!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Do not let this structure fall!

VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendStructure_W00=Repel our foes!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendStructure_W01=Keep them away from that structure!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Guard this from the enemy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Defend this at all costs!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendThing_W00=Protect our ally.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendThing_W01=Kill any who threaten our ally.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Maintain our grasp on the watch tower!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DefendTower_W00=Do not let them take our tower!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Defend_W00=Defend this place tooth and claw!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Bring that structure down!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Demolish that structure!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyStructure_W00=Attack that structure!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyStructure_W01=That structure must be destroyed!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=Eliminate that target!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Dispatch them, quickly!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyThing_W00=Attack with no remorse!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_DestroyThing_W01=Vanquish and destroy!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Our enemy has eluded us. Be on the lookout.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=The enemy has gone to ground. Beware.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_EnemyMissing_W00=I've lost the scent, but they're close!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_EnemyMissing_W01=They've slipped past me, but I know they're near!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero00=Tear our enemy to shreds!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_KillHero_W00=Kill!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=I move to you at once!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=I am headed your way!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_OnMyWay_W00=Making my way to you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_OnMyWay_W01=Headed for you now.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Retreat00=Fall back!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Retreat01=Make your retreat!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Retreat_W00=We cannot stay in this fight.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Retreat_W01=Flee this battle!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Transport00=We must move this.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Transport01=Get this thing moving, now!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Transport_W00=Guard this with your lives.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_Transport_W01=No one will take this from us!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Cash in your collection.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Relinquish what you've gathered.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_TurnIn_W00=Turn these in at once!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ping_TurnIn_W01=It's time to turn these in.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed00=Yes? Out with it!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed01=You will address me with proper accord!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed02=You're making me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed03=I've had fools clapped in irons for less.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed04=I once built a massive wall to shield my people from contact with the outside world. You're reminding me why.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed05=Once Gilneas has been reclaimed, it will need to be rebuilt. I wonder if those Defias fellows are still available...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed06=Hmm? Of course the sword is just for show. I have a gun, you fool.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed07=I wanted to put a wolf's head on Gilneas's flag, but my lawyers kept going on about copyright infringement.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed08=The Greymane Wall prevented all contact with the outside world. Because, thankfully, no one in Azeroth has a way to fly over large structures or teleport to a known location.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed09=This gun is a product of Gilnean industry. It is of the highest "caliber."
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed10=Have you ever been to Shadowfang Keep? I used to frequent it in my youth, but these days it seems that it's always under new management.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed11=Gilneas was walled off from the rest of the world for twenty years. So you'll forgive me if I don't get every cultural reference you kids make.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed12=A full moon? Tonight? No! I will turn into a monster! Hah, I jest. I can turn and tear out your throat at any time I want!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed13=A Forsaken once pounded on the northern gate and shouted "I'll huff and puff and blow your wall down!" We had a good laugh before covering him in boiling tar. Then we had a better laugh.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed14=By the way, did you know that the Greymane Wall is one of the few objects that can be seen from the Twisting Nether? It's true!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_Evo00=Out with it.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_Evo01=Proper accord.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_Evo_W00=What?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_Evo_W01=<Growls>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W00=What do you want?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W01=Speak.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W02=<Menacing growl>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W03=Don't ask where the sword goes when I transform. Just don't.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W04=These "tauren" had not yet joined the Horde when I walled off Gilneas. Am I to understand that they are bovine humanoids? "Cow people"? Well that's just preposterous.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W05=The night elves were the first worgen. They just have to be the first at everything.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W06=Deep in the Blackwald, we worgen gather beneath a giant tree that soothes our bestial nature. It is a peaceful place. But it smells awful.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W07=Keep it up, and you'll be crying wolf.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W08=You've really got a bone to pick with me, haven't you?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W09=This suit is wool, you know. I guess I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing. Goodnight, everybody!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W10=<Grunts> Damn fleas! Oh wait, that's you again.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W11=I fear nothing! Except perhaps a visit to the vet.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W12=Honestly, I'm more of a cat person.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W13=Some say I'm a harsh ruler. But you know what? It's a dog eat dog world out there.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Pissed_W14=When Gilnean dock workers go on strike, it can be hard to keep the wolves at bay. <Chuckles at his own joke>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected00=The strong live on!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Resurrected01=You have earned my favor, healer.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd00=This is Gilnean justice!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd01=Let this be a lesson to my enemies!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd02=The weak cannot stand above the strong.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd_W00=Satisfaction.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd_W01=Now who's playing dead?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeEnd_W02=<Satsified Laugh>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart00=You will suffer, as have my people.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart01=You will pay for your insolence!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart02=I will not forget this.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart_W00=You've made a powerful enemy.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart_W01=Nothing is more dangerous than a cornered animal.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/RevengeStart_W02=I'll tear you limb from limb!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive00=Gilneas will prevail.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive01=I've survived much worse than this.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Revive02=I will not fail my people again!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Dance00=Well, now it's a party.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Dance01=Care to dance?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Dance_W00=I'm something of a party animal.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Dance_W01=<Happy panting>
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Goodbye00=Good day.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Goodbye01=Never forget. Never surrender.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Goodbye_W00=Until next time.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Goodbye_W01=May the great wolf spirit guide you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Hello00=Greetings to you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Hello01=Gilneas will rise again.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Hello_W00=Greetings.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Hello_W01=Fate has brought you here to me.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Sorry00=I have failed you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Sorry01=My sincerest apologies.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Sorry_W00=That was my fault.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Sorry_W01=I apologize.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Thanks00=You have my gratitude.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Thanks01=I offer my thanks.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Thanks_W00=I am honored.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_Thanks_W01=My thanks to you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_WellPlayed00=You are a valuable ally.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Now you, I can count on.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_WellPlayed_W00=Nicely done.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Social_WellPlayed_W01=The day is yours.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec00=Naturally.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec01=A worthy choice.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec02=The curse grows stronger...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec03=Conviction is the weapon of kings.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec04=The strength to stand alone.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W00=Good choice.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W01=Something I can sink my teeth into.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W02=You can teach an old dog new tricks.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W03=Half a beast, but twice the man.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Spec_W04=I hear Goldrinn's howl.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt00=You are no match for my anger.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt01=I'll shoot you where you stand.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt02=How dare you defy a Gilnean king!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo00=No match.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo01=Shoot you.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo02=No idea.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo_W00=Smell fear.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo_W01=Fool.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_Evo_W02=Run away.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W00=I can smell your fear.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W01=Only a fool challenges an alpha wolf!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Taunt_W02=Run away, little one.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/TeamKilled00=Show them the strength of our pack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked00=My rage will be unleashed!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExLocked_W00=My rage is unleashed.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased00=This curse will be my greatest weapon.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_ExPurchased_W00=This curse is my weapon.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift00=I used to scoff at charity. Now I see its worth.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Gift_W00=A gift? Interesting.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Lockin00=Gilneas will rise again!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase00=I am the lord of my pack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Purchase_W00=I am the lord of my pack!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial00=Let's go for a run, shall we?
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_Trial01=You doubt my strength? Prepare to be enlightened.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Gilneas was besieged for years. I'm ready to fight.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Hesitation is a sign of weakness.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W00=Hurry. I'm ready to fight.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitLocked_W01=Hesitation is a sign of weakness.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=A true leader must be the first to battle.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=A bored wolf makes for a dangerous companion.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W00=A true leader must be the first to battle.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/UI_WaitPurchased_W01=A bored wolf makes for a dangerous companion.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used00=You cannot hide from me!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used01=Marked for the hunt!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used02=Now you are the prey!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Cannot hide...
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Marked for hunt.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo02=My quarry.
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used00=Unleash my rage!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used01=I'll rip you apart!
VoiceOver/GreymaneBase/Ultimate2Used02=The beast within!

VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed00=What's the plan?
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed01=Shh... I'm trying to think here...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed02=All I ever wanted to do was study... Of course then a giant demon smashed my home apart... So that kind of put an end to that.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed03=I wonder if my teleport spells will work here. Now where'd that spell go? Ah here it is! Azeroth metrion zinthos. Wait, that's not right...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed04=So, forget what I said before... NOW is when things are getting weird. I mean, I saw a dwarf made of candy earlier!
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed05=Wait, is that a white hair? I hope that's not a bad sign.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed06=Sure is nice to get outside once in a while. Feels like I've been cooped up in a tower for years.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed07=I wonder why they call it polymorph when it always turns enemies into one thing? They should have called it something like "monomorph" or "that spell that turns people into sheep."
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed08=I'm a sorceress, and a thumping good one too.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed09=Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart? <SFX: ice block magical sound> Because you're encased in ice... so you probably should start.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed10=I put a spell on you. Because you are mine.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed11=Let's just be clear... These aren't magic tricks... They're illusions. Tricks are something you do during in Hallows End for candy.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed12=I'm sorry, what? Thrall and me? Ugh... Who keeps spreading that filthy rumor? (beat) Besides everyone knows I prefer blue over green.
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed13=Not to mention the last two men who sought my attention both tried to take over the world. Yeah, I think I'd rather just study...
VoiceOver/JainaBase/Pissed14=The Horde and alliance can co-exist, I've seen it. One single event could draw us together.

VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed00=What, mortal?
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed01=I must hunt soon!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed02=Hmm? Me? A dreadlord? I don't know what you're talking about.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed03=I always did say to be careful of who you trust.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed04=The Alliance and the Horde are destined to destroy each other. I'm only helping the inevitable along.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed05=I serve the Lich Lord, Kel'thuzad. For now.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed06=Wings, hooves, and horns... and we're one hundred percent certain I'm not a Diablo skin? ...all right, if you say so.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed07=Bleh! <clears throat> Sorry, an old Nathrezim habit.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed08=The Nathrezim and the Nerazim are totally different. Any resemblance between our shadowy nature and green glowing weapons is merely coincidence.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed09=*sniff sniff* Do you smell that? Oh, no... My Legion is burning!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed10=What's it like being a female Dreadlord? Exactly like being a male, only I actually accomplish my goals.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed11=Personally, I just want to dismantle the Horde. Piece, by piece.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed12=One, two, three! Three invasions of Azeroth! Ah ah ah!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed13=Dreadlords don't sparkle. We scintillate.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Pissed14=So Varian, Garrosh and a Dreadlord walk into a bar. The bartender says "We don't serve your kind." then I say, (aggro)"I don't serve your kind either!" and slaughter the fool!

VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Resurrected01=As was foretold.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Revive00=The eternal night beckons.

VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_Hello01=How will this benefit me?
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_Sorry00=<chuckle> Oh, "sorry."
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_Sorry01=Mmm.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_Thanks00=Keep up with your share.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_Thanks01=A paltry tribute.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_WellPlayed00=Oh? Unexpected.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Social_WellPlayed01=Clever. I will be watching you closely.

VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Taunt01=Drown in your terror!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Taunt02=Flee, and perhaps you will prolong your life.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/TeamKilled00=We will return... as Legion.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_ExLocked00=I await your counsel.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_ExPurchased00=You would call on me?
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_Gift00=Very well.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_Lockin00=Vanquish the weak!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_Purchase00=Let the carnage commence.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_Trial00=A trial? And what will you offer me in return?
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_Trial01=Fine, I will show you the Legion's true strength.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_WaitLocked00=I grow impatient.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_WaitLocked01=Advice is not offered freely, mortal.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Standing around doing nothing? Ha, a Dreadlord specialty!
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/UI_WaitPurchased01=I must feed soon. Let us join the fight.
VoiceOver/JainaDreadlord/Ultimate1Used00=Fel-emental, rise and kill!

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroBoast01=The power of darkness shall be their end.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion00=I pray you are prepared for the war before us.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion01=Are you ready?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Arthas00=I sense that you struggle to control the darkness. You are not worthy of it.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=I sense darkness within you, demon. Less than others, yet still enough to serve me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=Interesting. You stand beside a Lord of Darkness, yet show no fear...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Hmm. The darkness and the light clash within you... No creature can serve two masters forever.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Demon00=A being of pure darkness. Serve the Eternal Empire and you may live.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Do not trouble yourself. I have conquered worlds alone before...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Positive00=I believe you may have use to me. Let us both hope I am right.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=A creature of light... The eternal empire has faced beings like you before. They were delicious.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond00=Your lack of faith disturbs me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond01=The question is, are you?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroRespond02=Concern yourself with what concerns you.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Ana00=You have use to me, so I will overlook this insolence, for now.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Arthas00=Ah, a king who believes he commands the dead... I see much that argues otherwise.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=You shall soon find out.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Crusader00=I have not been called by that name... since... Speak it again and you will regret it.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Demon00=You have use to me, so I will overlook this insolence, for now.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Diablo00=Your tone reminds me of many who now no longer exist. I suggest you rethink it.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Monk00=I am not who you think I am, human. Consider yourself fortunate you do not know me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Murky00=If that is what you wish, I will not impede your wrath.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Negative00=Enough.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Positive00=Dispense with the pleasantries... there is much to do.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Yes, light-creature... give into the fear, so the darkness may consume you.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill00=Far too easy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill01=You lack conviction.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill02=The Empire suffers no traitors.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill03=An insignificant display.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Kill04=Consider this concluded.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillArthas00=Death surrounds you, but you are not its master.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillAzmodan00=Why must you rebel, demon? Our desires are the same.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillBarbarian00=Have you considered armor?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillButcher00=Such anger... Such hatred. You will serve, beast.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillCrusader00=I find you are overly fond of speaking, Crusader.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDemonHunter00=You may wield the darkness, but you were not born of it.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillDiablo00=The Eternal Empire could use your power Diablo. Join me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillMonk00=Pray to whatever gods you wish. They cannot save you from me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillSpreeEnd00=Even your best pale before me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillTyrael00=How curious. An angel? Or just a being of light posing as one?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillUther00=All who wield the light will be snuffed out.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWitchDoctor00=You toy with power beyond your comprehension.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/KillWizard00=You... are not her... yet your death pleases me regardless.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Collect00=Claim these, before our enemy.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Collect01=Gather these.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Danger00=Stay out of there, if you wish to live.

VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendStructure01=We must guard this structure.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendThing00=Our ally is under attack. They must not fail.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendThing01=We must defend our ally, now.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DefendTower00=Defend this watch tower.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Tear that structure apart.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Demolish that structure!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DestroyThing00=Eliminate the target, immediately.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_DestroyThing01=The enemy desires their ally's survival. Disappoint them.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_EnemyMissing00=The enemy has fled, but they cannot hide forever.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Our foe is proving elusive. How annoying.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_KillHero00=Show this hero the power of the darkness.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_OnMyWay00=You shall not march alone.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_OnMyWay01=I will join you shortly.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Retreat00=Fall back to a better position.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Retreat01=Retreat, now.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Transport00=Prepare for transport.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_Transport01=Move this out.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_TurnIn00=It is time. Let us turn these in.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ping_TurnIn01=We must turn these in at once.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed00=What is it?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed01=You are testing my patience. That is most unwise.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed02=The Eternal Empire has consumed many worlds. Their power is bound to me through the darkness.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed03=Under my watchful gaze, we have crushed each of our foes but one. Why are these Star Princesses so resilient? ...And it's not the power of love. Stop saying that, it's stupid.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed04=I'm a Space Lord, mother mother.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed05=So, we have a deal. No, wait, I'm altering it! Ah, much better. Hmm, this part could be altered further... Yes, YES! This deal is getting better all the time.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed06=Never underestimate the power of the darkness. Seriously, don't. Darkness gets all passive aggressive about it. Leaves little sticky notes... everywhere.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed07=If you ever build an impractical phenomenally large super weapon don't skimp on quality control. The smallest oversight often leads to disaster.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed08=There are always two space lords. One, the master, the other an apprentice. Our meetings are lonely... and one-sided.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed09=Yes, the power of darkness looks like some sort of red hologram. What of it?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed10=<angry exertion> This visor always gets fogged up. <SFX: Squeegee sounds> Ah, much better.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed11=Some say that the Eternal Empire's name is presumptuous. Wait, I mean some "said" it is presumptuous. Tense is important when referring to the dead.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed12=These glowing lights don't serve any real purpose. But if you're getting a robotic body, you might as well splurge and trick it out.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed13=It's not a real space opera until the fat alien sings.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed14=You have no idea how many AA batteries I go through.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Pissed15=No one ever mentions that space is really really boring. It's big, it's mostly empty, and the few bits that aren't are full of jerks.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected00=Unending service. Eternal loyalty.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Resurrected01=Well done, servant of the Empire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive00=And so, the circle becomes complete.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive01=I am eternal, as our empire is eternal.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive02=Ah... Let the inquisition continue.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive03=Did you think you were rid of me?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Revive04=I do not die. I do not live.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Dance00=I find this humiliating.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Dance01=Does this amuse you?
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Goodbye00=Leave me.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Goodbye01=Goodbye.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Hello00=I permit you to speak.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Hello01=Say what you wish, but watch your words.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Sorry00=A new contingency has arisen. Adapt to it.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Sorry01=Be prepared, we may need to change our tactics.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Thanks00=Ah, good.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_Thanks01=You have served me well.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_WellPlayed00=Impressive. Quite impressive.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Social_WellPlayed01=You had a certain success.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec00=The darkness grows stronger.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec01=Our foes will know true suffering.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec02=Hmm. Fitting.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec03=You do not disappoint.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Spec04=Good, something of use.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt00=You are insignificant.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt01=Come, and meet your destiny.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Taunt02=I will deal with you myself.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/TeamKilled00=Nooooo!
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExLocked00=This disturbance had best be important.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah, a familiar presence...
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Gift00=As you wish.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Lockin00=This galaxy shall suffer.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Purchase00=Glory to the Eternal Empire.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial00=Ah, a new world to subjugate.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_Trial01=You desire a show of power? Allow me to demonstrate.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked00=Join me, and this galaxy will fall before us.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitLocked01=My patience is not without its limits.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased00=Know that when you grow tired of waiting, I shall remain unfazed.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/UI_WaitPurchased01=So many stars... Each will be made to serve in time.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used00=None escape their destiny.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used01=Ha, I've got you now.
VoiceOver/LeoricSpacelord/Ultimate1Used02=Welcome to the arena of fate.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/AI_GoodJob01=Boldly done.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/AI_GoodJob02=Ha, I approve.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/AI_Heal00=You require healing.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/AI_Heal01=Visit the healing fountain before you visit the god of death.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/AI_OnMyWay01=I will help.

VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=There is much for us to settle once this battle is over, demon.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=You are a god I have not seen before...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=Is there no rest for you, Mad King?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=What creature is this? Perhaps you are from Skovos?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=<sigh> I see the gods wish to test my patience today...

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_Danger01=Darkness lingers near you.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_Defend00=Defend this point with all your strength.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=We must defend our core!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Defend our fort!

VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed00=Where does your path lead?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed01=I serve the Patriarchs of Ivgorod, chosen by the thousand and one gods.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed02=I had not believed my path would lead me here, but so it has.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed03=Meditate first upon your action. Then, you will act with wisdom... Or so I hope.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed04=I have traveled many lands and seen many people. In them, wisdom is as rare as a jewel nestled in a mountain peak.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed05=I traveled once with an honest warrior who believed only lies, a god who did not believe in her own kind, and a wise ancient who spoke only foolishness.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed06=My first breath was drawn under the sign of Ytar, god of the sun. I wear his raiment, and hear his guidance.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed07=I am thankful I was not born under the sign of a lesser god. There are gods of idleness and slovenliness, and many serve them well--perhaps too well.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed08=I do have my own hair, if you must know. I shave it out of piety.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed09=I have punched through countless wooden boards and fasted for days at a time. But the tattoos on my face still hurt the most... 
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed10=My heart is steadfast. My spirit is pure. My mantras are... consistent.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed11=When using the Exploding Palm technique, always remember one thing... Your palm should not actually explode.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed12=Empty your mind. Be formless. Shapeless, like fire. If you put fire into a cup, it burns through the cup, and the table, and even the entire house. Be fire, my friend. Not the cup.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed13=I see you serve Sovyat, the god of poking people without end. He must be very proud of you.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed14=You must defeat Shenlong to have a chance. And he's been dead for a millennia. Good luck to you.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed15=My strikes are fast, like lightning... It is a little bit frightening.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed_Evo00=Path leads where?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Pissed_Evo01=Serve Patriarchs...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected00=You do the work of the gods, friend.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Resurrected01=My friend, our work is yet unfinished.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeEnd00=May you return with greater wisdom.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeEnd01=Meditate upon this.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeEnd02=I am without sin. Strike me, and you shall repent.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeStart00=You would anger the gods?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeStart01=I will see you answer for that.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/RevengeStart02=You shall be punished, heretic.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive00=The gods bid me to continue!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive01=My time has not yet come.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Revive02=I serve once more.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Dance00=Few have perfected these moves!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Dance01=I feel that Ivgorod groove...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Goodbye00=We will meet again.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Goodbye01=May you find what you seek.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Hello00=Greetings.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Hello01=How do you fare?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Sorry00=I was mistaken.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Sorry01=My error grieves me.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Thanks00=My thanks.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_Thanks01=You have my gratitude.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_WellPlayed00=You fight with purpose.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Admirable.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec00=My understanding grows.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec01=My path becomes clear.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec02=The gods favor me.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec03=Ytar has raised me to new heights.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Spec04=My mind is stronger.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt00=Are you bent on self-destruction?
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt01=Face me, and you will fall.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt02=Your weakness disgusts the gods.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt_Evo00=Bent on destruction...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt_Evo01=You fail...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Taunt_Evo02=Weakness...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/TeamKilled00=This is only a test. We shall pass it.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExLocked00=I am the fist of the gods.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_ExPurchased00=I shall keep the balance.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Gift00=I see I am needed elsewhere.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Lockin00=Ytar, guide my path.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Purchase00=The gods have favored you with wisdom.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial00=A trial? Excellent.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_Trial01=Ah, let me show you a few techniques.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Those who do nothing become nothing.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Time is always moving. I should be too.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=There is no triumph without risk.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=The gods do not reward those who do not act.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used00=The gods strike through me!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used01=Feel the wrath of Ytar!
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Ytar's wrath...
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used00=A thousand and one blessings upon you.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used01=The gods give you strength.
VoiceOver/MonkBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Gods give strength...

VoiceOver/Necromancer/TeamKill_Red00=Red team dominated.
VoiceOver/Necromancer/TripleKill00=Triple kill.
VoiceOver/Necromancer/TripleKill01=Triple kill.
VoiceOver/Necromancer/TripleKill02=Triple kill.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Attack00=It is time! Eliminate them all.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Attack01=Attack now, leave them no chance to regroup!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Attack02=Quickly! Bring the fight to our foes!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Caution00=Be careful... I sense death closing upon us.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob00=I quite enjoyed that.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob01=Mmm. I've fought better.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob02=We are unstoppable.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_GoodJob03=Oh, I've missed this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Heal00=The stink of death lingers upon you. Wash it off in a healing fountain.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Heal01=I would heal if I were you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_MercCapture00=These mercenaries shall join our cause.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_OnMyWay00=Looks like you could use some assistance.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_OnMyWay01=Ah, let me aid you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Retreat00=And now I make my exit.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Retreat01=I'm returning to town... er, to the hall of... whatever it is.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh00=<Sigh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh01=Saw that one coming.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/AI_Uhoh02=Another ally in death's hand.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack00=You will be made silent.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack01=As the Balance decrees.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack02=Go into the blackened night!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack03=Do not fear death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack04=Trag'Oul's blade whispers your name.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack05=Now... you die!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack06=Know the abyss as it knows you!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack_Evo00=Balance... decrees.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack_Evo01=Go... into night...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack_Evo02=Fear... death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack_Evo03=You die...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Attack_Evo04=Know abyss.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/CantMove00=I cannot move...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Celebrate00=We have done well here.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Celebrate01=Celebration is in order.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Comeback00=Their time comes to its end. Keep fighting... we shall prevail!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Death00=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Death01=<Death exertion>

VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Death09=<Death exertion>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed00=Thank you, healer.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed01=Healing magic... Quaint, but useful.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed02=Exquisitely done.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed_Evo00=Healing... quaint.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Healed_Evo01=Better than... potion.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree00=Oh... Promise?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree01=Sounds agreeable.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroAgree02=It feels like I might actually enjoy this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroBoast00=All who oppose me... beware.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroBoast01=Those who disturb the Balance shall be unmade.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready? The battle approaches.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion01=Hmm... are certain you're ready for this?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=A butcher. Glad you're on our side.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Crusader00=You're from Sanctuary... Perhaps you know why my tome of town portal isn't working.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=So you're the next generation. Think you can keep up with an old man?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Demon00=Once this fight has concluded, ours will be just beginning, demon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Diablo00=Do you think you can put aside our differences for this fight Diablo?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dismissive00=Oh, it's you... And this was going so well...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Dryad00=An aura of natural magic swirls about you... Interesting.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Malthael00=<Do not record. Reuses introboast.>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Murky00=And what in the burning hells are you?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=Try not to die out there. I'd hate to have to summon a skeleton from your corpse.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Good. A powerful ally.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=Archangel Tyrael, it is good to see you continue to fight for the Balance.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroQuestion_Wizard00=Watch yourself, mage... Your kind has upset the Balance before.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond00=I face death as an old friend.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond01=Never doubt my skill.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroRespond02=That I am.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=You mock a priest of Rathma at your own peril.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Ah, yes... that does explain your presence. Very good.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=Very charming.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Crusader00=It's only been a long time to you...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=Hmm... Nephalem... So the legends are true. This should be interesting.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Demon00=I have never consorted with demons. I have no intention of starting now.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Diablo00=I know... too bad you can't. Or have you forgotten the last time?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Save your vitriol for someone who cares.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Dryad00=Come now... Death has been here all along.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Mocking00=Ah... Childish, much?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=That sound is rather chilling.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Only actions will get this over with. Not words.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=Come, we will uphold the Balance together.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=Tyrael... I'm glad to see you survived the Worldstone's destruction.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/IntroResponse_Wizard00=You know my apprentice? That's certainly odd.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill00=Just another corpse.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill01=Meet your death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill02=Never doubt my skills.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill03=It will take more than that to stop me.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill04=The Balance has been served.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Kill05=Ha! I've got your ear...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillArthas00=Merely a boy, masquerading as a god of death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillAzmodan00=Hmph. Duriel was tougher... And he was a giant maggot.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillD3Hero00=And I'm not even a nephalem.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDeath00=Well, that's one less "Master of Death" clogging up the Nexus.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDemon00=The Balance will be upheld, demon.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillDiablo00=Lord Diablo, I have bested you!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillLeoric00=I have no use for undead that refuse to obey.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillMephisto00=Good journey, Mephisto. Give my regards to the abyss.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillSpreeEnd00=The power of death is at my command.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillTyrael00=Apologies, angel. But those who upset the Balance will fall.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillUndead00=What a waste of undead flesh.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillWitchDoctor00=The dead are meant to serve, witch doctor. Not be served.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/KillZeratul00=You're right... Scythes ARE nice.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh01=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh02=<hearty laugh>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh03=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh04=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh05=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh06=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh07=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Laugh08=<aggressive laugh - after killing an enemy>
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal00=Ah, much better than those repulsive potions.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal01=The icy grip of death thaws.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowLifeHeal02=Well done, healer... Well done, indeed.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana00=I require... mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana01=Not enough mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana02=I wish I had a mana potion.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/LowMana_Evo00=Low mana.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No00=Ha. No.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No01=I cannot.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No02=Impossible.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/No03=(sigh) Why should I?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistHero00=Our ally is imperiled.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe00=I need help!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AssistMe01=Assist me!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Attack00=We should attack... here.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=Destroy their core!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=Capture this mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Level this fort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_AttackTower00=Hmm... this watch tower would be useful to us.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Capture00=Let us claim this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Capture01=Capture this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Collect00=Ah, we should collect these.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Collect01=Let's take these.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Danger00=Look out.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Danger01=Death lurks here.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Defend00=We should make our defense here.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Defend our core!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=Defend our fort.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=We must defend this structure.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Keep this structure intact.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Defend our ally.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendThing01=We must protect our ally.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DefendTower00=Do not let them take this watch tower!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Bring that structure down.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Destroy that structure.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=This one's life must end.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=Take down the enemy now!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Stay attentive. Our enemy has disappeared.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=Our foe has gone missing. Do not let them catch you off guard.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_KillHero00=Death calls for this hero.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=I shall join you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=On my way to you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Retreat00=Retreat...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Retreat01=Away from there!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Transport00=We should move this... now.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_Transport01=We can leave this here no longer.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_TurnIn00=Turn in... now.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Come, let us turn these in.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed00=What is it?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed01=Must you disturb me?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed02=Hmm? Oh, yes, the scythe is new to me as well, but I must admit... I'm starting to like it.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed03=There are only two things that are inescapable... death and... Hmm. You know what? I forget what the second one was... Oh, let's just go with death twice.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed04=My, my... Death becomes you...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed05=We, the Priests of Rathma, have been charged to maintain the Balance, but it seems many do not understand what it is.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed06=Think of the Balance as a net... an unknowable safety net that keeps your soft pink insignificance from being consumed by oblivion. My charge is to maintain that net. Now, thank me!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed07=The leader of the Necromancers is known as the Deathspeaker. Three guesses what he likes to talk about...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed08=In my day no one would believe you if you said nephalem were real... and yet, here they are... and six of them no less! Rather excessive... isn't it?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed09=You think this is difficult? Ha! You're not even playing in Hardcore mode!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed10=You reap what you sow... and I sow the seeds of death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed11=Yes, I bring people back from the dead, but it's not a pretty picture.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed12=For the last time, a necromancer does not romance the dead... that's a necro--you know what, nevermind.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed13=Someday I'm going to have to figure out something to do with all these ears I've collected. Maybe I'll make a belt or something.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed14=Bring out your dead, you say? Don't mind if I do...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed15=Maintaining the Balance is difficult. But you buff an angel here, nerf a demon there, and the job gets done.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed_Evo00=What?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Pissed_Evo01=You... disturb me?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected00=I return... but not as a corpse. You will have to teach me this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Resurrected01=True resurrection? This feat should be impossible...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive00=So that's what death feels like... I miss it already.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive01=The Great Cycle of Being begins anew.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive02=There is more to do, it seems.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Revive03=Hmm? No corpse run? Oh, I like this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Dance00=You have to be very limber to do this.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Dance01=My skeletons taught me this one.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Goodbye00=May the guardian watch over you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Goodbye01=Preserve the Balance always.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Hello00=Greetings to you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Hello01=Salutations.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Sorry00=Forgive me.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Sorry01=My apologies.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Thanks00=Ah... thank you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_Thanks01=My thanks are yours.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Admirable.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Social_WellPlayed01=Now that was impressive.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec00=Interesting...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec01=Now that I shall savor.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec02=As it must be.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec03=You're a clever one...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Spec04=Ah. I was eying that as well.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt00=You... have a date with death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt01=You're right to fear me, but it will do you no good.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt02=I sense... life... upon you. Allow me to rid you of it.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt_Evo00=Date... with... death...
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt_Evo01=Fear... me.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Taunt_Evo02=Rid you... of life.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/TeamKilled00=Do not let death defeat you. Use it and take revenge.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExLocked00=Death is at my command.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ah... a familiar face.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Gift00=You're a generous one.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Lockin00=It is time.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Purchase00=Back in action.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial00=Now this is more like it.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_Trial01=Some practice, I see?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Shall we move along?
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Come, test my skill... I yearn to return to the battlefield.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=<Slight shiver> I should have brought a shirt.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Hmm. Battle.net is a lot shinier than it used to be.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used00=Poison nova!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used01=Fetid corruption!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used02=Befouled breath of the lifeless.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used03=Noxious essence.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Poison nova.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Corruption.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used00=Feel the chill of death.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used01=Death's grasp closes upon you.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used02=Rise in my service!
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used03=Let's slow things down a little.
VoiceOver/NecromancerBase/Ultimate2Used_Evo00=Chill of death.

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed06=We mortals are but shadows and dust...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed07=Muln Earthfury? No, I'm not related to that old ox. <beat> Although you could say my great grandmother WAS a cow...
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed08=You know... I raided for years, and still never got the helm for this set.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed09=It is said that only a shaman is allowed to know the balance and weight of their totem.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed10=Think of it, an all Shaman Expansion to World of Warcraft... We'll call it: Sham-WoW. The thing... it sells itself.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed11=Grah, what smells like wet dog? <beat> Oh, right.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed12=What? I'm not wearing a skirt... These are legplates... I swear! <beat> You know what, go look it up on Wowhead if you don't believe me.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed13=Thunder! Lightning! <loud crash> Whoa, that's kinda frightening.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed14=Don't tell anyone, but sometimes I turn into ghostwolf form just to /dance.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed15=Tell you what, if you stop this I'll split my winnings with you. 60/40. My way.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed16=I've got to say this whole "videogame" thing is nice. Might have to try it more often.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed17=Heroes of the Storm, huh? Got to say... I might just have an unfair advantage. <Sound Effect: rolling thunder> <laugh>
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Pissed_Evo00=Yes?

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec01=That should even the odds.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec02=I like the way you think.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec03=They won't see that coming.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Spec04=Ancestors bless me.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt00=The smart money's on me, whelp!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt01=Do you really think you can survive me? Hah, let's see.

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt_Evo00=Smart money... on... me.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt_Evo01=You cannot survive.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Taunt_Evo02=Another... weakling.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/TeamKilled00=Focus up! We can still beat them.

VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_ExPurchased00=Ancestors watch over you.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Gift00=A new team-mate? Hope they're up to snuff.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Lockin00=I will fight to my last breath!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Purchase00=Back into the ring!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial00=Pay attention to old Rehgar-- you may learn something.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_Trial01=Pay attention, I'm only going to show you this once.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Alright, this is getting old, fast.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Mmm, I hate sitting on the sidelines.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=How does Thrall deal with all this standing around?
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=You know, we COULD be fighting right now.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used00=Bathe in the power of the Horde!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used01=Feel the fury in your blood!
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Power of... Horde.
VoiceOver/RehgarBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Feel it... in blood.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack03=I fight on.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack04=Let none survive.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack05=To the death!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack06=Beg for your miserable life!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Attack_Evo00=Vengeance near...

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=You will serve.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=I'd kill you, but it's more amusing to see you humbled.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=You will die in agony... Just like your son.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Hah. At least I took a throne!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=No! And you should lay off the brew before a fight.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=You cannot be serious.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Hold your tongue, or I'll tear it out.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/IntroResponse_No00=<DO NOT RECORD. REUSES NO SOUND>

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed02=Do that again and you'll pull back a stump.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed03=Time flies like an arrow. Flesh flies like carrion.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed04=Fast is fine, but accurate is final.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed05=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels. Good thing my nerve endings rotted away.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed06=I have no time for games, yet I always seem to be in them... Hm...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed07=Everyone knows the Undercity has the best Hallow's Eve parties.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed08=The Wrath of the Lich King was nothing. Wait until you see the Wrath of the Banshee Queen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed09=No, I'm not going to sing for you. I'm a heartless undead ruler, not a music box.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed10=I thought I was the only one who'd been murdered by a cruel man, raised as a powerful but horrible abomination, subsequently crowned myself queen, and dedicated my subjects to orchestrating my vengeance. But then I met Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed11=Look, I've been a high elf, a banshee, and an undead high elf, but I've never been a night elf. I don't do "bouncy."
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed12=No, I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed13=Does anyone else hear that buzzing? 
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed14=A tisket, a tasket, I'll put you in a casket...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed15=Ugh! What the hell is that smell? Is that still me?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed_Evo00=We Forsaken...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Pissed_Evo01=Slave to torment...

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Response_CastingQ05=<whispered/ghostly>Talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected00=The darkness has not taken me... yet.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Resurrected01=Was that my val'kyr?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/RevengeEnd00=Hardly worth the effort.

VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Hello00=The Banshee Queen will hear you.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Hello01=<unamused> What?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Sorry00=That could have been better.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Sorry01=We are all fools of fate, at times.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Thanks00=<reluctant noise of acknowledgment> Mmhm.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_Thanks01=As you were.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_WellPlayed00=How cunning.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Social_WellPlayed01=You have your uses, don't you?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec00=That will suffice.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec01=Interesting.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec02=Very well.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec03=Fine.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Spec04=Victory draws near.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt00=I will teach you restraint.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt01=Insult me in life, and you will serve me in death.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt02=I was looking for a target... And here you are.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt_Evo00=Teach... restraint...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt_Evo01=Serve me in death...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Taunt_Evo02=Look for target...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/TeamKilled00=Do not fear. I have survived worse than this.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExLocked00=Stand with me, or fall before me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_ExPurchased00=The Dark Lady watches over you.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Gift00=How... noble.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Lockin00=Victory for the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Purchase00=A clever one, aren't you?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial00=Have I not endured enough trials?
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_Trial01=You toy with a power you cannot comprehend.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked00=Be done with it.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitLocked01=Unleash me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=I am not accustomed to waiting.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=My patience is at its limit.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used00=May my aim be true.
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used01=It's time to even the scales!
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo00=Aim true...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate1Used_Evo01=Even scales...
VoiceOver/SylvanasBase/Ultimate2Used00=You're mine.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Healed02=I am well again.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree00=I would expect no less.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree01=Indeed.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroAgree02=Let us unleash our fury.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast00=We will slaughter any who stand in our way.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroBoast01=They will pay with their blood.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready to see our enemies fall?

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Forsaken00=The Dark Lady has need of you.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Garrosh00=How the mighty have fallen.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Kaelthas00=Well, if it isn't our little princeling.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_LostVikings00=I see you staring.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Murky00=You would make a fine mur'ghoul, wouldn't you?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Negative00=I thought I was done suffering fools.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroQuestion_Positive00=You look like you could actually be of use here.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond00=Nothing could stop me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond01=Do not underestimate me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroRespond02=Our foes shall suffer.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_BloodElf00=Show them the strength of Quel'Thalas!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Forsaken00=You will serve.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Garrosh00=I'd kill you, but it's more amusing to see you humbled.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_GennGreymane00=You will die in agony... just like your son.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Kaelthas00=Hah. At least I took a throne!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_LostVikings00=No! And you should lay off the brew before a fight.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Murky00=You cannot be serious.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Negative00=Hold your tongue, or I'll tear it out.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_No00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/IntroResponse_Positive00=This will be a... convenient partnership.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Kill00=The penalty for treason is death!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillBloodElf00=Shorel'aran, sindorei.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKaelthas00=A weakling, just like your father...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillKerrigan00=There's only one queen on this battlefield. You are but a pawn.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSkeletonKing00=I lead the undead!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/KillSpreeEnd00=I will never stop fighting... Never.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_Defend00=Defend this position!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendStructure00=Protect this structure.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendStructure01=This structure must hold!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DefendThing00=Do not let this one fall.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Decimate this structure.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DestroyThing00=This one must die.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_DestroyThing01=This fool must be taught a lesson.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Our foes are missing. Cowards.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ping_EnemyMissing01=The enemy evades us.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed00=What are we if not slaves to this torment?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed01=We are the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed02=Do that again and you'll pull back a stump.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed03=Time flies like an arrow. Flesh flies like carrion.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed04=Fast is fine, but accurate is final.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed05=You have no idea how tough it is to do this in heels. Good thing my nerve endings rotted away.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed06=I have no time for games, yet I always seem to be in them... Hm...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed07=Everyone knows the Undercity has the best Hallow's Eve parties.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed08=The Wrath of the Lich King was nothing. Wait until you see the Wrath of the Banshee Queen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed09=No, I'm not going to sing for you. I'm a heartless undead ruler, not a music box.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed10=I thought I was the only one who'd been murdered by a cruel man, raised as a powerful but horrible abomination, subsequently crowned myself queen, and dedicated my subjects to orchestrating my vengeance. But then I met Kerrigan!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed11=Look, I've been a high elf, a banshee, and an undead high elf, but I've never been a night elf. I don't do "bouncy."
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed12=No, I was never in Night Ranger... but I have an all-dead girl group called band-she.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed13=Does anyone else hear that buzzing? 
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed14=A tisket, a tasket, I'll put you in a casket...
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Pissed15=Ugh! What the hell is that smell? Is that still me?

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Response_CastingQ05=<whispered/ghostly>Talah!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected00=The darkness has not taken me... yet.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Resurrected01=Was that my val'kyr?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/RevengeEnd00=Hardly worth the effort.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/RevengeEnd01=What a bore.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/RevengeEnd02=A clean death was more than you deserved.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/RevengeStart00=My hunt has no end.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/RevengeStart01=I have plans for you!

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Revive02=I have no time for games.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Dance00=I tend to avoid this sort of thing outside of the Wickerman Festival.

VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Goodbye00=I take my leave.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Goodbye01=Farewell.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Hello00=The Banshee Queen will hear you.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Hello01=<unamused> What?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Sorry00=That could have been better.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Sorry01=We are all fools of fate, at times.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Thanks00=<reluctant noise of acknowledgment> Mmhm.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_Thanks01=As you were.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_WellPlayed00=How cunning.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Social_WellPlayed01=You have your uses, don't you?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec00=That will suffice.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec01=Interesting.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec02=Very well.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec03=Fine.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Spec04=Victory draws near.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt00=I will teach you restraint.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt01=Insult me in life, and you will serve me in death.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Taunt02=I was looking for a target... And here you are.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/TeamKilled00=Do not fear. I have survived worse than this.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExLocked00=Stand with me, or fall before me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_ExPurchased00=The Dark Lady watches over you.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Gift00=How... noble.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Lockin00=Victory for the Forsaken.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Purchase00=A clever one, aren't you?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial00=Have I not endured enough trials?
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_Trial01=You toy with a power you cannot comprehend.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked00=Be done with it.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitLocked01=Unleash me.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased00=I am not accustomed to waiting.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/UI_WaitPurchased01=My patience is at its limit.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used00=May my aim be true.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate1Used01=It's time to even the scales!
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used00=You're mine.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used01=Hear the Banshee Queen.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used02=Listen and obey.
VoiceOver/SylvanasRanger/Ultimate2Used03=Such a feeble mind.

VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed12=After a couple of Heroes of the Storm expansions, Blizzard replaces me with Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed13=The blow that killed Orgrim permanently dented the backplate of this armor. It serves as a constant reminder that the enemy can strike where you least expect it.
VoiceOver/ThrallEarthbreaker/Pissed14=Wait, what? What do you mean there's lore in this game? You guys actually paid someone to write a story about Raynor meeting Diablo? Isn't this precisely what fanfiction is for? <Sigh> I didn't approve any of this.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed03=<inhales> Ah, I miss real time strategy.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed04=The isometric perspective, the epic large scale battles...
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed05=Can't say I miss all this poking, though..

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed08=I am a lean green fighting machine.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed10=Which came first? The Doomhammer or the Doomhammers? Think about it.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed11=Lets see what abilities they gave me this time... Chain Lightning... always good. Feral Spirt... Windfury... Hah, sorry Rehgar... Looks like I got all the good stuff.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed12=After a couple of Heroes of the Storm expansions, Blizzard replaces me with Garrosh.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed13=The blow that killed Orgrim permanently dented the backplate of this armor. It serves as a constant reminder that the enemy can strike where you least expect it.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Pissed14=Wait, what? What do you mean there's lore in this game? You guys actually paid someone to write a story about Raynor meeting Diablo? Isn't this precisely what fanfiction is for? <Sigh> I didn't approve any of this.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected00=Thank you.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/Resurrected01=I'm glad you're around.

VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_Trial01=Pay attention. I'm only showing you this once.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked00=Let me show you the power of the elements.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitLocked01=We should delay no longer. There is a war to be waged.
VoiceOver/ThrallHellhammer/UI_WaitPurchased00=What could you possibly be doing right now?

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Positive00=Hail, friend! What do you say, ready to dispense some Justice?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Stitches00=By the Light, what kind of abomination are you?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Sylvanas00=Sylvanas? <beat> You look like hell.

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zerg00=Is it me? Or are you zerg getting more bizarre over time?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroQuestion_Zuljin00=So this is the mighty Zul'jin? Can't say I'm impressed.

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond01=It shall be a pleasure.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroRespond02=By the Light!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Alliance00=Glory to the Alliance!

VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Butcher00=And there goes my hearing...
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Cranky00=In my day, we respected our elders. ESPECIALLY when they're the healer!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Crusader00=Please... I was swinging the Light while you were still in short pants.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=Yes, we get it, you're edgy. Congratulations. Can we move this along?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Excited00=Hah! Now this is going to be one to remember.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Greymane00=Hah, good to hear it, you old dog. <beat> Uh, sorry.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Horde00=Adding "new" to the Horde's name, doesn't absolve you of your sins, you know.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Impressed00=All right, let's see what you've got.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Jaina00=That guilt lies with me, and I will live with it until my dying day.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Leoric00=No wonder your people killed you.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Medic00=Wha-- Which part? The giant eagle shoulder pads? Or is it my magical first-aid hammer?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Mocking00=They call you a hero? Hah. I've scraped more muck off my boot that was more heroic.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Murky00=You want to run that past me again?
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=You know, you sound awfully familiar.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Negative00=Just shut up, will you? We've got a battle to win.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NewRace00=You're from Azeroth? I swear, you leave the planet for a few years and everything goes to hell.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_NightElf00=And here I thought high elves were full of themselves.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Positive00=Ha! Let's show these bastards what we can do.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Stitches00=I'm not dignifying that with a response.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Sylvanas00=And I thought being dead would make someone LESS aggressive.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Uncaring00=Oh, are you expecting me to give a damn? Ha. That's rich.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Varian00=For the Alliance!
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zerg00=You'd best remember whose side you're on, beastie.
VoiceOver/Uther/IntroResponse_Zuljin00=Yes, that's precisely the kind of comment I'd expect from a troll.

VoiceOver/Uther/Kill04=You're not even trying!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAlliance00=I beg your forgiveness, my friend.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillAngel00=Hmm. I think I just killed a spirit healer!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillArthas00=Rot in hell, boy.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillChogall00=Looks like paladins and ogre magi aren't quite equal afterall.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillCrusader00=Oh... What happened to all that "outclassed" talk?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDemon00=Back to the nether with you! Or, you know, wherever!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillDiablo00=This world will not suffer your kind, demon!
VoiceOver/Uther/KillGuldan00=Even "darkness incarnate" pales before the light.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillHorde00=New Horde look, same Horde waste.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillJaina00=<sigh> How unfortunate...
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKaelthas00=You still have a lot to learn, Kael'thas.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillKerrigan00=Justice has come for you, Kerrigan.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillMedivh00=What Lothar's blade started, let my warhammer finish.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillPaladin00=May the Light have mercy on my soul.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillRaynor00=Looks like you could use a little more training, Raynor.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillScourge00=As I live, Lorderaeon will never fall to your wretched Scourge.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillSpreeEnd00=Nice try.
VoiceOver/Uther/KillVarian00=What's my line again?
VoiceOver/Uther/KillWar200=Ahh, now that takes me back.
VoiceOver/Uther/Laugh00=<chuckle>
VoiceOver/Uther/LowHealth00=My health is low.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack03=Didn't see this coming, did you?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack04=I think you'll regret this.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack05=You're almost not worth it.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack06=I don't know why I trouble myself.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack_Evo00=How this feel?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack_Evo01=Grave waits...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Attack_Evo02=You dare...

VoiceOver/WizardBase/Healed_Evo01=Health...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree00=This will be interesting.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree01=Consider this a demonstration.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroAgree02=Wait until you see what I can do.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast00=This isn't going to end well for anyone who isn't us.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroBoast01=I studied too long to be bested by five people from nowhere.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion00=Are you ready for victory?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion01=You'd better be prepared for this fight.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Azmodan00=Have you come here to suffer another crushing defeat, Azmodan?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Butcher00=Now that's a face I never wanted to see again. 
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_D3Hero00=Our foes ahead may be the strongest we have faced together.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Deckard00=Cain! I found you again!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Leoric00=We are on the same side? This doesn't make sense.

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Necromancer00=A necromancer... Do you know Mehtan?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Negative00=I'm fighting alongside you? I can't believe this...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Positive00=This will be a fun battle. I can tell!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_SpaceLordLeoric00=Your evil will not triumph here, Space Lord!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroQuestion_Tyrael00=I am so glad that you have joined me, Tyrael.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond00=Naturally!

VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroRespond02=I can hardly wait.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Angry00=We could just leave this fight and have our own, you know.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Azmodan00=Can't I go anywhere without you talking at me?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Begrudging00=Mm, right. Fine.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Butcher00=(sarcastic) You always were so very eloquent.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_D3Hero00=They certainly haven't become any smarter.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Deckard00=How did I know you were going to say that?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Dismissive00=(sigh) Do we really have to do this?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Insult00=Did you have to look up those words before you used them?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Leoric00=Better than my alliance with you.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_LordofHell00=It's not me you should be worried about.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_MagicUser00=Watch closely, and you might learn something from me.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Malthael00=I hope someone slices your wings off!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Murky00=If you can't say something intelligent, then don't say anything at all.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Necromancer00=I'm a wizard, actually. You're the one who seems a little unbalanced.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Negative00=Don't think too hard. You might hurt yourself.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Positive00=It's such a relief when I don't have to do everything myself!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Sarcastic00=Oh, this is going to be just wonderful.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_SpaceLordLeoric00=In the name of the stars, I will punish you!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Tyrael00=I would not have it any other way.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/IntroResponse_Weird00=Hm. Maybe I should have stayed in school after all...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill00=I am unstoppable!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill01=I am so good I astound myself.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill02=If only they could see me now!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill03=Your defenses are nothing!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Kill04=I'm just warming up!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillAngel00=Don't underestimate a nephalem.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillButcher00=Now who is the fresh meat?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDeckard00=Eh, what have you gotten yourself into this time, Cain?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDemon00=You never learn to leave me alone, do you?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiablo00=That was for Leah.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillDiabloHero00=Hm, were you someone important?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillJaina00=Better to be a wizard than a mage.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillKaelthas00=You elf mages just cannot compete with me...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillLeoric00=How many times do I have to do this?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMalthael00=Hm. You die a lot faster the second time around.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillMedivh00=The wizard's duel is over. You lost!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillNephalem00=I didn't mean to do that... I promise!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillSpreeEnd00=(laughs) That was entertaining.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillTyrael00=My apologies for that, friend...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/KillWeird00=You're dead now, but how were you even alive? Ugh.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh00=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh01=<small laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh02=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh03=<medium laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Laugh04=<larger laugh>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal00=Thank you for your kindness, healer.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal01=I must have a new guardian angel.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowLifeHeal02=You have an excellent sense of timing!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana00=I need mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana01=I don't have enough mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana02=Need more mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/LowMana_Evo00=Need mana.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No00=Why would I do that?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No01=No way.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/No02=I'm not going to do that.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistHero00=This warrior could use our aid.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe00=A little help, please?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AssistMe01=I... need some help.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Attack00=Attack!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackCastle00=It's time to strike at their core!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackMerc00=I want to take this mercenary camp.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackOutpost00=Let's attack this fort!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_AttackTower00=We should seize this watch tower!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Capture00=We should capture this.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Capture01=Go forth and capture this!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Collect00=We need to collect more of these.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Collect01=Head out and gather these things.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Danger00=I feel like something terrible is about to happen here...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Danger01=Danger is lurking nearby.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Defend00=Defend this point!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendCastle00=Our core cannot fall! We'll lose!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendOutpost00=That fort needs help. Now!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendStructure00=Defend this with all you have.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendStructure01=Focus your attention on protecting this.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendThing00=Listen to me! This one must survive.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendThing01=Keep this one safe.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DefendTower00=We'd better protect this watch tower.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DestroyStructure00=Hm. This structure will make a lovely pile of smoking ash. 
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DestroyStructure01=Bring this structure down!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DestroyThing00=This one is ready to die, if you ask me.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_DestroyThing01=We'd do well to kill this one already.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_EnemyMissing00=Wait. Where did the enemy go?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_EnemyMissing01=(sarcastic) Oh, good. Our foe disappeared.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_KillHero00=We need to slay that hero.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_OnMyWay00=Fortune smiles on you. I'm on my way.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_OnMyWay01=Don't worry. I will go to you.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Retreat00=Retreat!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Retreat01=I am heading back, and so should you.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Transport00=This thing will not move by itself.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_Transport01=We should transport this.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_TurnIn00=We should turn these in as soon as we can.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ping_TurnIn01=Go and hand these things over.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed00=I will fulfill my destiny.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed01=Mm... Magic has always come easily to me.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed02=Yes, I am the wizard who destroyed the Yshari Sanctum. But I had no choice.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed03=Is anyone paying attention? Or are you paying too much attention?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed04=I studied the ancient secrets of magic just to be annoyed by you! How did you know?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed05=(a little threatening) This seems like a good time to practice my silence spell.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed06=Let's see how you fare with this! <SFX: Magic casting sound>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed07=(Muffled sounds of confusion as the Wizard realizes she silenced herself)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed08=<SFX: Magic casting sound> Ahem, I have, uh, never made that mistake before. 
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed09=If you speak of this to anyone, I will blast you into another plane of existence!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed10=My teachers always used to tell me that I was full of myself. But that can't be true... I can't get enough of me. <giggle>
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed11=It's funny that Eirena equips a "focus" to cast spells. You know, because she's still so... so... Mm. Oh, let's just say she's "distracted."
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed12=I once cast magic missile into the darkness. ...boy, was he sore about it.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed13=I'm a whiz of a wiz. I mean, if ever a whiz there was, that is. <laugh> Get it?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed14=Isendra was a great teacher, but she always kept a secret or two to herself. I'm still not sure how she managed to teleport so quickly... and without a cooldown!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed15=I love this glove's power. It's so bad.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed_Evo00=Fulfill destiny...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Pissed_Evo01=Magic... easy...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected00=You are my new favorite healer!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Resurrected01=You're better than a Zakarum priest!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive00=Looks like I won't be dying today.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive01=Oh, that was not what I intended...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Revive02=I should try to be more careful. Or not.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Dance00=Want to see a magic trick?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Dance01=Wizards just want to have fun.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Goodbye00=Bye!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Goodbye01=Good-bye!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Hello00=Greetings.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Hello01=A pleasure to see you.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Sorry00=My fault.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Sorry01=Sorry about that.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Thanks00=Thanks.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_Thanks01=Thanks a lot.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_WellPlayed00=Now that was an accomplishment!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Social_WellPlayed01=It's so nice to have equally accomplished allies.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec00=My power grows.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec01=Nicely done.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec02=If my old masters could see me now...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec03=My knowledge increases.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Spec04=I become more powerful.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt00=Hope you've made your peace.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt01=Are you ready to die?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt02=A foe worth killing!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt_Evo00=Make peace.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt_Evo01=Ready to die?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Taunt_Evo02=Foe worth kill.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/TeamKilled00=This is difficult, but we must not lose hope.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExLocked00=Do you require the aid of a wizard?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_ExPurchased00=I am here to help.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Gift00=I shall go where the need is greatest.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Lockin00=This realm needs me.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Purchase00=I knew I liked you.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial00=You want me to show off? (laughs)
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_Trial01=Magic is no mere toy to play with. But just this once...
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked00=You need only say the word.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitLocked01=[Angry]I don't just cause problems.[/Angry] [Serious]I can also solve them.[/Serious]
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased00=Any time now.
VoiceOver/WizardBase/UI_WaitPurchased01=Will I be moving today?
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used00=I am too much for you!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used01=This is your end!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used02=A taste of the arcane!
VoiceOver/WizardBase/Ultimate1Used03=<laughs>
